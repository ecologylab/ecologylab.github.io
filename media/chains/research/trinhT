Who speaks? ... S/he who speaks, speaks to the tales as sh/he begins
telling and relling it.  S/he does not speak about it...  the story
and its telling are always adaptive.  Marginality: who names? whose
fringes? An elsewhere that does not merely lie outside the center but
radically striates it.  [We] date to cross the borders to introduce
into language everything monologism has repressed... The struggle is
always multiple and transversal -- specific but not confined to one
side of any border war... To use marginality as a starting point
rather than ending point is also beyond it towards other affirmations
and negations.  Dispacement involves the invention of new forms... to
which one refers in fabricating the tools of resistance... Displacing
is a way of surviving.  It is an impossible, truthful story of living
in-between regimens of truth.  The war of borders is a war is a global
war waged by the West on a global scale to preserve its values.
Strategies of displacement defy the world of compartmentalization and
the systems of dependence it engenders, whie filling the shifting
space of creation with a passion named wonder.  A creative event
... requires that one leaves the realms of the known, and takes
oneself there where one does not expect, is not expected to be.

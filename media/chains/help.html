O.K.  So maybe something isn't working just right for you.  What could
be the problem?

Well, first of all, this site is best viewed with Netscape Navigator
3.0. If you see images and text that are always left-justified, its a
sure sign of a weak browser. We suggest that if you don't have
Netscape, download it now! 

<P>
<B>Helper Applications</B>
<BR>
CHAINS Web is media rich.  There are many images, sounds, a few video
clips.  The images are almost all JPEG, because they compress the
best, which means your download times are as short as we can make
them.  Almost all browsers these days support "inline JPEG's".  If
yours doesn't, again, you might want to get another.
<p>
By the way, when a helper application starts, it comes to the front
over the browser.  If it's playing sound, you can immediately click
back onto the browser and continue to look at a page while the sound
is coming.
</P>
<p>
Sounds and video require
<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/navcomponents_download.html"> 
Helper Applications</A>.  If you click on
a sound or a video and you get a message like "downloading <whatever>,
save ..." it means either you don't have the helper appplications you
need, or your browser has not been configured properly.
</P>
<p>
<B>Sound</B>
<br>
If you are using Netscpae 3.0, the Helper Applications you need are
probably already installed.  When you click on a sound file Netscape
should automatically launch the right helper application for you.  
<p>
For <em>sound</em>,  8Khz 8-bit mono in the .au format is the default.
This is LO-FI. For Windows, Netscape provides a player for AU format
called "NAPLAYER".  For the Mac, you can download <A
HREF="http://jupiter.anutech.com.au/tprogman/SoundMachine_WWW/welcome.html">Sound
Machine</a>, which is freely available. 
</p> 
Optional choices for sound are labeled HI-FI: 22Khz 8-bit stereo in
the .WAV format.  For Windows, configure your browser to use the
"MPLAYER" application which is located in your "/WINDOWS" directory.
For the Mac, download  <a
href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~franke/SoundApp/">Sound App</a>. 
</p>
<P> 
<B>Video</B><br>
For <em>video</em>, clips, we use the Quicktime format.  If you are
using Netscape 3.0, chances are you already have the Quicktime
plug-in.  However, Windows users will also need Apple's Quicktime
code. Get Apple's  Quicktime Plug-In Version 1.1 for Windows <a
href="http://www.quickTime.apple.com/sw/win_end_user_1.1.html">here</a>.
For the Mac, get Apple's Quicktime Plug-In Version 1.1 <A
HREF="http://www.quickTime.apple.com/sw/mac_end_user_1.1.html">here</a>.

			The ACM Multimedia 2010 Interactive Art Program is the 7th of its kind. We have listed examples 
			of past Multimedia Art exhibitions below.
		</p>
		
		<h4>ACM MM 2008 Vancouver, Canada</h4>
		<b><span class="h6">BorderZones</span></b>
		<p>
		This exhibition was held at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scienceworld.bc.ca/">Science 
		World British Columbia.</a> The show presented artworks that explore zones in which multimedia is 
		used to shift, traverse, intersect, and combine genres and modalities to provoke the emergence of 
		new frameworks, <a target="_blank" href="http://mmart.iat.sfu.ca/index.html"> read more ></a>
		</p>
		
		<h4>ACM MM 2007 Augsburg, Germany</h4>
		<b><span class="h6">I / You / Other</span></b>
		<p>
		The representation of the self has been the concern of artists for centuries. An essential 
		aspect of portraying the self is necessarily self-reflective, especially if the own physical body 
		and its movements form the basis for expression. Yet, the body is indispensably connected with 
		space in time and thus interacts in environments that alter between natural or artificial, social 
		or isolated. Whatever the context, the gained experience enforces the understanding of the self for 
		the individual but also mirrors the environment through the 'I',

		<h4>ACM MM 2006 Santa Barbara, CA, US</h4>
		<b><span class="h6">Remote</span></b>
		<p>The emergence of digital, geospatially-aware networks, and the rapid spread of digital technologies 
		are redefining the way we communicate and relate to each other and the world, creating infinite 
		possibilities for a multiplicity of perspectives on culture, location, approaches to the generation 
		of content, and all forms of communication,

		<h4>ACM MM 2005 Singapore</h4>
		<b><span class="h6">Presence/Absence Art</span></b>
		<p>For centuries, artists and philosophers have explored the notion of presence from multiple 
		perspectives, considering its physical, psychological, and cultural dimensions. In that exploration, 
		technology has played an important role, not only in the development of the tools used for the 
		'representation' of presence, but also in defining it: from the revolution in painting brought 
		by photography, to the new concepts of presence brought by technological advances in the last 
		sixty years (virtual reality, telepresence, immersive presence, experiential systems, etc.),

		<h4>ACM MM 2004 New York, NY, USA</h4>
		<b><span class="h6">Digital Boundries: Multiculturalism, Identity, and Awareness</span></b>
		<p>At no time in history has technology had the prospect of making a stronger cross-border impact 
		on culture. Technology can be used to create or reinforce boundaries (being fingerprinted and 
		photographed at an airport-- a multimedia experience), as well as to dissolve them (we are 
		bombarded by images and sounds from all over the world). Many of us are being empowered with the 
		ability to easily create digital content, document and share our own experiences and those of 
		others, challenging the roles of art (passive vs. interactive) and revolutionizing the way we 
		see and hear the world. At the same time, only a small percentage of people have access to 
		technology (boundaries of those that have it versus those that don't),

Coded Messages: CHAINS explores an intercultural interface ecosystem
by juxtaposing the drum language performance of the Ewe people of
Ghana, West Africa, with the advertisements of multinational corporate
society.  The performance strategies of CHAINS  are based on the
compositional and media integration aesthetics of Ewe performances --
which blend drumming, dancing, singing, costumes and architecture in a
unified expressive form -- and avant garde performance strategies from
environmental theater and new music.  Like the site specific
performances in the remote village of Anyako and the historic slave
trade Castle at Cape Coast, which preceeded it, the CHAINS WWW site
builds its context into the delivery of its messages. 

<p>
The CHAINS performances were featured in the 1994 Pan Africa Theater
Festival, PANAFEST.  The
<a href="../index.html" >WWW form of Coded Messages: CHAINS</a>
was awarded honorable mention in the
<a href="http://prixars.orf.at/">1996
Prix Ars Electronica</a>.  The CHAINS site is ranked in
<A HREF="http://point.lycos.com/reviews/database/zzhut002.html">"The
Top 5% of all Web Sites," by Lycos</a>, and
<A HREF="http://magellan.mckinley.com/review.cgi?sid=29344">four stars
by Magellan</a>
and NetGuide.  The "Annotated Coded Messages: CHAINS" is featured in
the
<A HREF="http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/LEA/gallery.html">Leonardo
on-line journal</a> of MIT Press.<p>
Visitors can find audio, video and photos from the performances,
interpretive translations and background information, and the CHAINS
Grafitti Wall, where you can add your own images, text, and links to
the site. Now in its second year on the Internet, the CHAINS web site
draws approximately one hundred visitors per day. 

<p>
CHAINS also reflects both the powerful potential and the limitations
in sharing which are inherent when empathetic post-colonial interfaces
between cultures originate in the center and seek the margins.  With
the voyeuristic power of the computer desktop, the visitor can access
all, but can only translate some coded messages.  So, too, with the
economic position of Americans, the instigators of the CHAINS
collaboration  opened some borders, while others remained sealed in
another zone of 100% multinational authentic experience.

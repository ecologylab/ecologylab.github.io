ACM Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) '08 Conference</a>, 5-10 April
2008, Florence, Italy
</div>

<h4>aim and topics</h4>

<div class="text1">
This one-day CHI08 workshop seeks to specify and investigate the contextualized operation of significant processes of collecting, such as selecting, combining, organizing, and distributing, within dynamic digital mixed media environments. Given that the delivery of information resources is ultimately experiential, what are the requirements for these operations with respect to representing collections for meaningful human and machine interaction and manipulation?
</div>

<div class="text1">
This workshop brings together artists, designers, curators, librarians, DJs, VJs, ethnographers, psychologists, semanticists, and system builders to share and develop new integrative methods for representing multimedia collections. The outcome of the workshop is a report containing the results of the workshop as well as the next steps in development. A follow up publication in form of a special issue in a journal such as TOCHI or Journal of Human Computer Interaction is planned. 
</div>

<div class="text0">
This workshop builds on the results of the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~media/conferences/mhc05/mhc05.html">ACM Multimedia Workshop 'Multimedia for Human Communication - From Capture to Convey (MHC 05)</a>, which developed a general model of commonly carried-out tasks in information manipulation and consumption [9]. 
</div>

<h4>participants</h4>
<div class="text1">
This workshop invites the participation of artists, interface designers, graphic designers, art collectors, and developers working with samples, surrogates, and recombinant information. This includes:
</div>

<ul>
<li>collage artists working with physical or digital media
<li>musicians and VJs who remix audio - video samples;
<li>members of cultural institutions, such as museums and libraries, who are involved in selecting, preserving, annotating, organizing, and presenting media collections;
<li>installation artists, tangible media makers, and developers of responsive environments and context-aware applications or applications that assemble elements from diverse sources;
<li>ontologists, cultural theorists and ethnographers involved in collecting;
<li>cognitive scientists who consider the cognition of associations;
<li>system builders: designers, hackers, scientists, and engineers who make tools and applications to support processes of collecting and combining. This includes tools for sample-based composition, and for developing collections in any digital medium. It also includes applications that dynamically generate recombinant information from collections of information resources.
</ul>

<h4>background</h4>
<div class="text1">
Art and media provide a perspective on found objects as representations. Sampling of found objects has been used as a source of materials for composition for almost a century [7]. Samples can function simultaneously as sensory representations, and semantic and navigational surrogates. In that way a surrogate functions as "a replacement for an original item, … which gives some description of the item, and how it can be obtained" [2]. Typical examples of surrogates include entries in catalogues, bibliographic citations, Google result set elements, bookmarks or playlists, and video clips. Each surrogate does not only exist as replacement, but is also a significant object itself. People often form ideas and make decisions based on surrogates. They are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Surrogates operate semiotically, as signs, by affecting meaning through signifier - signified relationships [1]. As a unit of meaning, a surrogate can be recontextualized. An example is the work of hip-hop artists such as Public Enemy [10] who use samples of James Brown as surrogates in their work. 
</div>

<div class="text1">
Rather than seeing collections as atomized lists of separate elements, recombinant information puts surrogates together to create connected wholes [6]. Units of meaning are assembled. The result then is a connected knowledge space. Its structure may differ depending on the aim of the user. A digital librarian most likely addresses surrogates as descriptive elements. A VJ or a curator might understand surrogates rather as conceptual and creative material, which enable organizing the material as an experience. End users need both of these perspectives.
</div>

<div class="text1">
Understanding the dynamics of recombinant information with respect to
its establishing processes, such as collage [7, 13], montage,
detournement [3], hypertext [10], and remix [8, 14], is essential to navigation in common knowledge spaces. It form the basis for retaining some identification of citations and finding the way back to source material, and also for representing new forms of knowledge. The outcome might be that the reader of the space is provoked into new interpretations of meaning. Recombination involves processes and techniques of selection, positioning, fastening, and transformative treatments
</div>

<div class="text0">
The goal of this workshop is to investigate commonly carried-out tasks and activities in practices of information authoring, distribution, and consumption. Essential questions that need to be answered include:
</div>
<ul>
<li>What are people doing with collections? What are their goals, needs, and desires?
<li>How can representations support creative processes such as exploratory search [15], collection sensemaking [12] [4] and information discovery [5]?
<li>What types of surrogates are in use? What types are possible? What range of syntagmatic (personal speech) and paradigmatic (institutional speech) expressions do they facilitate?
<li>What metadata needs to be gathered to support information visualization, personalized context-oriented adaptation, and creative recombination, in addition to retrieval and navigation?
<li>What issues of privacy are relevant and how can we address them?

</ul>

<h4>aim and topics</h4>

<div class="text1">
The goals of this first one-day workshop are to examine processes involving samples, surrogates, and recombinant information, to understand the contexts of these processes, such as collecting and manipulating, arranging, assembling, repurposing, appropriating, and composing, and to develop new ideas about how digital tools can support them. The focus of recombinant information workshops in this first year is to understand user needs and desires, the potentials to create new forms, and to draft specifications for studies and requirements.
</div>

<div class="text0">
The focus of this workshop lies on the provision of requirements that allow automatic and semi-automatic recombinant systems to function as self-standing systems or as part of larger creative environments.  We invite regular and position papers that address a number of specific issues:
</div>

<ul>
<li>methods for forming surrogates, and representing collections of surrogates;
<li>identification of aesthetic and usability criteria of those who put together and those who use collections;
<li>analysis of sensory characteristics and semiotic functions of surrogates as signs;
<li>developing roles for metadata in surrogates and recombination;
<li>imagining functionalities for algorithms and tools.
</ul>

<h4>participants</h4>
<div class="text1">
This workshop invites the participation of a artists, collectors, and developers working with samples, surrogates, and recombinant information, including:
</div>

<ul>
<li>digital libraries and archives: those involved in selecting, preserving, annotating, organizing, and presenting collections;
<li>ontology makers, data designers, ethnographers, and cultural theorists involved in collecting;
<li>developers of adaptive hypermedia who are interested in the form of delivery;
<li>developers of tangible media, responsive environments, and context-aware systems;
<li>psychologists interested in memory and the cognition of visual and auditory information;
<li>collage artists working with physical or digital media;
<li>musicians and VJs who remix audio - video samples;
<li>installation artists;
<li>artists, designers, hackers, scientists, and engineers who make tools and applications to support processes of collecting and combining. This includes tools for sample-based composition, and for developing collections in any digital medium. It also includes applications that dynamically generate recombinant information from collections of information resources.
</ul>

<h4>background</h4>
<div class="text1">
Art and media provide a perspective on found objects as representations. Sampling of found objects has been used as a source of materials for composition for almost a century [5]. Samples can function simultaneously as sensory representations, and semantic and navigational surrogates. In that way a surrogate functions as "a replacement for an original item, … which gives some description of the item, and how it can be obtained" [2]. Typical examples of surrogates include entries in catalogues, bibliographic citations, Google result set elements, bookmarks or playlists, and video clips. Each surrogate does not only exist as replacement, but is also a significant object itself. People often form ideas and make decisions based on surrogates. They are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Surrogates operate semiotically, as signs, by affecting meaning through signifier - signified relationships [1]. As a unit of meaning, a surrogate can be recontextualized. An example is the work of hip-hop artists such as Public Enemy [7] who use samples of James Brown as surrogates in their work. 
</div>

<div class="text1">
Rather than seeing collections as atomized lists of separate elements, recombinant information puts surrogates together to create connected wholes [4]. Units of meaning are assembled. The result then is a connected knowledge space. Its structure may differ depending on the aim of the user. A digital librarian most likely addresses surrogates as descriptive elements. A VJ or a curator might understand surrogates rather as conceptual and creative material, which enable organizing the material as an experience. End users need both of these perspectives.
</div>

<div class="text1">
Understanding the dynamics of recombinant information with respect to
its establishing processes, such as collage [5, 9], montage,
detournement [3], hypertext [7], and remix [6, 10], is essential to navigation in common knowledge spaces. It form the basis for retaining some identification of citations and finding the way back to source material, and also for representing new forms of knowledge. The outcome might be that the reader of the space is provoked into new interpretations of meaning. Recombination involves processes and techniques of selection, positioning, fastening, and transformative treatments
</div>

<div class="text0">
The purpose of this workshop is to provide an understanding of the role, technologies, and applicability of recombinant information to the tasks of managing and reusing various media.  The particular questions we address are:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Which approaches to surrogate construction address which user needs?
<li>What makes recombinant information? 
<li>What are good strategies for putting surrogates together into recombinant information forms? 
<li>How can the development of these roles contribute to utilitarian (task-centered), creative, and entertainment contexts and concerns? 
<li>How can recombinants support social interaction and community building? 
</ul>

<a class="destination" href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~nack/">Frank Nack</a> is a senior researcher at CWI, currently working in the Multimedia and Human-Computer Interaction group. He obtained his Ph.D. with a thesis on "The Application of Video Semantics and Theme Representation for Automated Film Editing," at Lancaster University, UK. The main thrust of his research is on the representation, retrieval and reuse of media in distributed hypermedia systems, educational hypermedia systems that enhance human communication and creativity, computational assistance for the development, maintenance and usage of hypermedia systems and distributed hypermedia systems, computational applications of media theory & semiotics, automated video editing, interactive storytelling, and computational humor theory. He was member of the MPEG-7 standardization group where he served as the editor of the Context and Objectives Document and the Requirements Document, and chaired the MPEG-7 DDL development group. Frank is on the editorial board of IEEE Multimedia, where he serves as associated editor in chief and edits the Media Impact column.

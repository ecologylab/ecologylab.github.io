This research area develops digital collections that emphasize human
expression. Collections tend to be represented in linear forms, which
are cold and impersonal.
When we collect sets of information resources based on processes of
human expression, we need to develop associational ontologies and
browsing schemas that connect form and content.
</p>
<p>
Sensemaking is the process through which humans put together understanding 
of related information. Sensemaking has been said to involve changes in 
cognitive representations during a human information processing task. 
Collection sensemaking involves understanding a collection of media entities, 
as a whole. One example of a sensemaking task is to compare the damage from 
Hurricane Katrina to homes, personal effects, and community buildings in 
different areas of New Orleans. Connected visual and semantic representations 
provide perspective to support users involved in collection sensemaking tasks. 
A zoomable map organizes images based on location at varying scales. Multiscale 
clusters based on zoom level organize images associated with events. The 
clusters afford contextualized thumbnail browsing and also maintain uniform 
information density on the map. Metadata enhances context and memory in the 
process of collection sensemaking.

Access to devices that integrate Global Positioning data with image 
and sound acquisition becomes more common, enabling people to build 
large collections of locative multimedia. As the size and number of 
these locative media collections grow, so too does the importance 
of systems that support collection sensemaking. Media semantics, 
which include automatically acquired location data, as well as 
user-supplied annotations, play a key role in these user-centered 
processes of collection utilization. The 
system is currently being used to document the location and condition 
of homes and neighborhoods in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

Research on human computer interaction involving computer vision-based 
motion tracking needs to start with the body, and then consider technology. 
The body is the site of experience. We sense the environment, form 
understandings, and actuate responses. Movement is an actuated essence of 
people�s everyday experiences. Movements articulate locomotion, and also 
convey information regarding emotions and intentions. We used human movement 
as the basis for designing a collaborative aesthetic design environment. Our 
intention was to promote social interaction and creative expression. We 
employed off-the-shelf computer vision technology. Movement became the basis 
for the choreography of gestures, the development of gesture recognition, and 
the development of imagery and visualization.

Experiences of intimacy and connectedness through social networks are vital to human sense of well-being. We live in an electronic habitat. Electronic mail functions as a medium of interpersonal exchange. As it accumulates, email data becomes more than a collection of reminders. It is a diary we didn�t know we were keeping, and a potential source of valuable insight into the structure and dynamics of one's social network. Current interfaces do little to help users see patterns of social interaction within email data.
</p>
<p>
faMailiar is a multiscale email interface that utilizes computed intimacy measures and chronology as parameters for information visualization. Rhythms of intimacy in email experience are made visible as patterns of color and shapes in a zoomable chronological grid. Qualitative user experience data indicates that such an email visualization can provide striking insights into the experience of social connectedness over time. These insights potentially enable users to better manage how they invest time and energy into personal and work relationships, and thus to improve overall sense of well-being.

Students are prone to experiencing culture shock as they cross boundaries.
On their arrival to the U.S., displaced students from the Third World
often feel isolated, afraid, inferior, and insecure. 
The intention of this project is to support these students, as they
adapt to their new cultural context.
Digital collections can serve as a
medium for sharing sensations and experiences, through the form of
personal stories. 
<a target="_blank"
 href="../woezo">Woezo</a> is a collection of stories, designed to
help international students overcome culture shock, as they cross
borders and enter the U.S.

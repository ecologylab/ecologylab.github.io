The Interface Ecology Lab investigates human-centered computing support for expression, creativity, and social engagement. 
Research involves examining situated practices, designing interfaces, building software components and distributed systems, and designing new methods of evaluation. Cognitive and ethnographic inquiry enable the development of semantics, collections, tools, social networks, installations, and performances that open the role of computation in human experience to promote creativity, discovery, communication, play, contemplation, satisfaction, and survival.

<a class="checkthis" href="sensoryInterfaces.html">Embodied interfaces</a>
research  integrates embedded systems with HCI and the interface ecosystems approach, to imagine and develop new embodied experiences through computing and signal processing.
We create new devices and experiences,
using low power sensors, computers, and networking. 
Context is modeled based on
recognized patterns. Affordances are designed; 
 systems responds with clear feedback and
 media, to stimulate particpants' senses. <br/>
The flagship project is our

<a href="ecosystemsApproach.html" class="checkthis">Interface Ecology</a> is a metaframework, an epistemological underpinning that connects theory and practice, constructing the interface as a border zone between heterogeneous systems of representation: organic and machinic; physical and electronic; analog and digital; cultural and economic; text, image, and sound; and engineering, science, humanities, and the arts. Forms and processes are transformed by investigation of new connections between representational systems. Identification of differences stimulates the production of new knowledge. An example is interdisciplinary collaboration, in which the process of resolving mismatches between methodologies can serve as a catalyst for developing innovative inter-methodologies.

We are developing new digital games for <a href="tec.html" class="checkthis"><b>T</b>eaching <b>Te</b>am <b>C</b>oordination</a>. This research takes ethnography of fire emergency response work practice as a 
basis, and develops simulations of aspects of team coordination. Real-world actions map to game activity, as players work together to find 
real goals and avoid virtual hazards.
We invented <i>Zero-Fidelity Simulation</i>, a method that focuses on reproducing the communication and information distribution components of target environments to produce engaging, low-cost, and effective educatioal experiences.

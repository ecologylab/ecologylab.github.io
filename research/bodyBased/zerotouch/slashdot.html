Researchers Jon Moeller, Andruid Kerne, and a team from the <a  href="http://ecologylab.net">Interface Ecology Lab</a> at Texas A&M University showcased the latest <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/255244/zerotouch_turns_55inch_tv_into_touchscreen_gets_ready_for_market.html">ZeroTouch multi-finger sensing technology at ACM CHI</a>, in Austin. ZeroTouch is a new spin on infrared sensing technology, which <a href="http://ecologylab.net/research/publications/moellerKerneZeroTouchCHI2012.pdf">optimizes the sensor readout cycle</a> for a linear array of modulated infrared light receivers.

ZeroTouch is a high performance cost-effective solution for television scale multi-touch sensing, as the researchers showed through <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6uDAQ928Zk">integration of the sensor with a 55 inch LCD TV</a>. ZeroTouch also constitutes a precise free-air sensing technology (Kinect can be used as a complementary technology to sense depth). Researcher Bill Hamilton uses ZeroTouch integrated with Wacom Cintiq to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4D8atZf2z4">showcase new embodied eSports interaction</a> for the open source <a href="http://zero-k.info">Zero-K</a> real time strategy game.

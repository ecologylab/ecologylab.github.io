<p>Welcome to The Interface Ecology Lab team gaming study. We are excited to have you join in the game!</p>
<p>This page will answer a few frequently asked questions, as well
as provide the live information on what game slots are available.</p>
<p>We are offering a <b>gift card ($30)</b> to anyone attending 4
one-hour weekly sessions, each with <b>free food</b>! Because we are
interested in the way teams operate, we encourage you to sign up with
friends, in groups of 4, but we will group individuals as necessary.</p>
<p><b>What are the benefits?</b></p>
<p>Aside from getting paid to have fun playing a game, we expect
that your ability to work together as a team will improve.</p>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p>An evolving game for teaching people how to work together in
teams. We need participants to test out different game configuration, so
we work to optimize how team members communicate with each other and
play the game.</p>
<p><b>What do I have to do?</b></p>
<p>Come in with your group for one hour a week for 4 weeks. You will
be asked to answer a few questions about your background in team work
and game play. You will then be asked to play a game with three other
people using varied team configurations. After that, we'll provide food
(every session). If you come to all 4 sessions, you will receive a $30
gift card to either Amazon.com, Target, or Best Buy. Your responses are
confidential. We will never give out your name.</p>
<p><b>How long will it take?</b></p>
<p>The study takes around 1 hour each week for 4 weeks.</p>
<p><b>When can I start?</b> - [ <a
	href="mailto:games@ecologylab.net?subject=Scheduling for the TTeCLoG Game Study">send
scheduling email</a> ]</p>
<p>We are listing the available time slots through an online
calendar. Let us know what time slot (1 hour) you (and your team) would
like. We are flexible on scheduling, and so we can accept multiple
sessions within a week, etc. Or let us know what other times are good
for you. Note that we will be running sessions all summer, you can start
in several weeks. We are filling slots on a first-come, first-served
basis.</p>
<p>We have groups that need players (listed above, and on the
calendar).</p>

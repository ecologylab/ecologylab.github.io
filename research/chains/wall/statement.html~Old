<center><h2>CHAINS Grafitti Wall Statement</h2></center>
The Coded Messages: CHAINS grafitti wall is a community space run by
the CHAINS collective under the auspices of New York University.  This
WWW CGI Graffitti Wall is not a public space.  We maintain the space
so that people can dialogue about topics like
<table><tr><td><ul>
  <li>African Culture</li>
  <li>Post-Modernism</li>
  <li>Intercultural Performance</li>
  <li>Marginalization</li>
  <li>Potentials and limits for collaboration across boundaries of
      culture, race, class,...</li>
  <li>Juxtapositions of Cultural Forms</li>
</ul></td></tr></table>
The wall exists as a channel of communication to foster understanding
amongst people.<p>
The wall has been attacked by white supremacist racists, sex mongers,
and other ripoff artists. These people are not welcome here. The wall
is not a place to express hate, nor is it a pickup joint.
If you come to the
wall, and post materials not consistent with the goals of this community,
you are tresspassing against our
wishes, in an attempt to deny our free speech.
You can speak where you are welcome and in public spaces as protected
by the constitution.  Get out of here with your garbage.

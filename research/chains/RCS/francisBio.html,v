Personal Statement</B></CENTER>
<P>
I, Francis Kofi, was born on 25th February, 1964 in Vogan, Togo.  (My
parents were Togolese, but born in Ghana).
<P>
My grandfather was the master drummer of the Gbenordu Haborbor Troup
in my hometown.  My father was also a member of this group, but he
died suddenly when I was two.  Because of the shock of my father's
death, my mother became disappointed in life and she could not take
care of me, so my grandfather looked after me.
<P>
At the early age of six, I was performing with my grandfather at
funerals and festivals.  During my school days I developed my interest
in traditional drumming and dancing.  I was the best drummer/dancer
among my mates.  Another sad fact is that I lost my grandfather when
I was thirteen years old.  At that time I began taking care of myself
by selling coconuts to pay my school fees.
<P>
At age fifteen, I joined People's Cultural Troup in Accra Newtown.  We
travelled for three months to Benin, Togo, and Nigeria where we
performed.  In 1980 I was invited by my grandfather's group to perform
with them at the yearly festival, Adzinukuzan, and we proceeded to
Burkina Faso.  My career as a drummer/dancer led me to join the Ghana
Dance Ensemble, the national dance company of Ghana, at the Institute
of African Studies, University of Ghana, Legon, in 1984.
<P>
Performing in the programmes of the Ghana Dance Ensemble I have
travelled extensively, performing in many countries including India,
U.S.S.R., Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, and the U.K.
I have won several prestigious awards (1989 Ghanaian Union of Canada:
Best Performer Award; 1992 Bloomsbury Society's (UK) Rudolph Dunbar
Award.
<P>
In 1992, I decided to resign from the Ghana Dance Ensemble in order
to travel to other African countries to learn more about African music
and dance.  During this period I travelled to Nigeria, Benin, Togo and
Burkina Faso.
<P>
In 1993, when part of the Ghana Dance Ensemble moved from the
University to the National Theatre, I was invited to join them.  I held
the position of master drummer of the Ghana Dance Ensemble at the
National Theatre until I resigned this year.
<P>
I still feel a strong desire to reach out beyond Ghana, to share
something very important with other musicians and to learn from them.
I have especially enjoyed opportunities to share my knowledge of
African music and dance with non-Africans.  I would welcome
invitations from schools or dance comapnies outside my country that
would be interested in my coming to share my experience with them.  I
will gladly provide references and a video tape of myself in performance.

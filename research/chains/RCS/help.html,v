O.K.  So maybe something isn't working just right for you.  What could
be the problem?<br>

Well, first of all, this site is Netscape enhanced.  Right now, you
need at least version 1.1 of Netscape or better to see the site as
we've created it.  (We expect to add some very cool stuff with
Netscape 2 features, real soon now.)  If you see images and text that
are always left-justified, its a sure sign of a weak browser.
We suggest that if you don't have Netscape, download it now;
you're really not seeing the Internet if
you dont have Netscape. This may require you to change service providers.<br>
<P>
<B>Helper Applications</B><BR>
CHAINS Web is media rich.  There are many images, sounds, a few video
clips.  The images are almost all JPEG, because they compress the
best, which means your download times are as short as we can make
them.  Almost all browsers these days support "inline JPEG's".  If
yours doesn't, again, you might want to get another.
<br>By the way, when a helper application starts, it comes to the front
over the browser.  If its playing sound, you can immediately click
back onto the browser and continue to look at a page while the sound
is coming.<P>

Sounds and video require
<A HREF = "http://www.netscape.com/MCOM/tricks_docs/helper_docs/">
Helper Applications</A>.  If you click on a sound or a video and you
get a message like "downloading <whatever>, save ..." it means either
you don't have the helper appplications you need, or your
browser has not been configured properly.
<P><B>Sound</B><br>
For <em>sound</em>,
8Khz 8-bit mono in the .au format is the default. This is LO-FI.
For Windows, Netscape provides a player for AU format.  For the Mac,
you can download
<A HREF=ftp://ftp.utexas.edu/pub/mac/util/soundmachine-21.hqx>
Sound Machine</a>, which is freely available.<BR>
Optional choices for sound are labeled HI-FI; these are really a sort
of medium-fi: 22Khz 8-bit stereo in the .WAV format native to PC's.  I
think this means that you don't need a helper application for them at
all under Windows.  For the Mac, download 
<a href = "ftp://ftp.the.net/mirrors/ftp.utexas.edu/sound/soundapp-151.hqx">
Sound App</a>.<P>
<B>Video</B><br>
For <em>video</em>, clips, we use the Quicktime format.  
You will need Quicktime for Windows.  For the Mac, get
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.utexas.edu/pub/mac/graphics/sparkle-231-fat.hqx ">
Sparkle</A> off the net, or use Apple Movie Player if you have it.<BR>

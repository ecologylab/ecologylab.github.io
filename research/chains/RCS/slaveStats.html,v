<h1>Slave Trade Statistics</h1>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
The actual number of men, women and children who were snatched from
their homes in Africa and transported in slave ships across the
Atlantic, either to the Caribbean islands or to North and South
America, will never be known.  Writers vary in their estimates, but
there is no doubt that their number runs into millions.  The
following figures are taken from Morel's calculations as reproduced by
Professor Melville J. Herskovits and cover the period 1666-1800:

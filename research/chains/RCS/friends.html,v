Meet key friends of Coded Messages: CHAINS.  Without these people, the
performances, and the multimedia would never have happened.

  <LI><b>J.H. Kwabena Nketia</b>, Director of the International Centre
      for African Music and Dance at the University of Ghana, deserves
      our deepest thanks for giving his endorsement to this project.
      He offered institutional support from the ICAMD and facilitated
      the project on many levels.  His conviction that CHAINS was a
      worthwhile endeavor helped make the performances a success.
      Prof. Nketia is a world reknowned scholar who has made a
      life-time contribution to promoting the study and understanding
      of African music and culture.  He has written prolifically on
      the subject of African music; his book <em>The Music of
      Africa</em>, is widely accepted as a definitive reference.  He was
      responsible for the creation of the Institue for African Studies at the
      University of Ghana, one of the first Africa-based institutions
      devoted to African culture.  He is also credited with
      contributing to the development of African music programs at
      American universities and colleges, including UCLA, and the
      University of Pittsburgh, where he was Chairman of the Music 
      Department.  As Director of the ICAMD, Nketia is committed to
      bringing to the scholarship of African music, by Africans, <em>in
      Africa</em>, the resources and facilities and recognition it deserves.

      presence is felt here on a multitude of levels. C.K. is simply
      one of the world's finest performers and finest 
      teachers. One who is always growing and bringing others into the
      process, C.K. is equally at home behind the master drum, on the dance
      floor, or sequencing electronic music on his computer.  He introduced
      us to his culture in the U.S, and gave us the hospitality of his
      family back home in Anyako.  C.K. is responsible for many of the
      translations and cultural histories in Coded Messages: CHAINS.
      C.K. is Professor of Music at the University of California, Berkeley.

      <LI><b>Gustav Hlomatsi </b>is the Chief Eve Translator at the Bureau of
      Ghana Languages in Accra, Ghana.  We met Gustav soon after
      arriving in Ghana and took daily lessons in Eve from him.  He led
      us expertly through the intricacies of the Eve language, and worked
      with us to build our conversational skills, which proved
      indispensable during our stay in Anyako.  Gustav also translated
      our interviews with Francis, which included many of
      the songs that  were later featured in CHAINS.

<font size=1><br></font>The process began on many levels with
<b>libation</b>. Among the Eve, and other tribes from the region, libation is
offered to ancestors as a convocation for auspicious events.
Ancestors are the focus of deep respect.      
<br><br>The offering of libation involves pouring some liquor on the ground in
a special pattern, followed by drinking a shot.  As the glass is
brought to each person present, s/he gives brief homage to the
ancestors.  The alignment and support of the ancestors' energies
serves to guide the task at hand.

Here you see our Anyako host, Joe Ladzekpo, one month before
our performance.  Mr. Joe is the <EM>tsiami <WBR></EM> or linguist of
Anyako.  The <EM>tsiami</EM> is the official orator who's job is to
eloquently represent the chief.    
<br><BR>
Mr. Joe secured the approval of the other living village elders for us
to perform in the town square, and then secured the approval and
blessing of the ancestors with this libation.

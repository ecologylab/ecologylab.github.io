			<h1>Summer of Code at the Interface Ecology Lab!</h1>

			<p>The Interface Ecology Lab is a supportive community of developers dedicated to human-centered computing, object-oriented design, and open source software.
			We are engaged in cutting-edge research that 
			<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../infocomposer/index.html">visualizes and embodies social and semantic information</a>, 
			with multi-touch interaction, for use in games, creativity support tools, interactive art, and other digital media. 
			Eight Summer of Code Internships enabled students from Romania, India, and The United States to participate.
			</p>
				
			<p>The foundation of our software is <a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../research/simplGuide/index.html">S.IM.PL</a>
				(Support for Information Mapping in Programming Languages),
				the best-in-class open source framework for developing distributed programs across programming languages that share and store complex data structures. 
				Its great for writing programs that connect iOS and WPF clients to Java servers.
				</p>
				
			<p>Built on S.IM.PL, 
				<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../research/simplGuide/metaMetadata/index.html">meta-metadata</a> 
				is a language and software architecture for metadata wrappers.
				
				for representing the rich structures of the world's metadata, 
				facilitating extraction, manipulation, visualization, and embodiment.
				
				Mmd transforms the web into a structured type system and ontology of semantics. This facilitates extraction, 
				manipulation, visualization, and embodiment of the world's data.
				We use meta-metadata to enable people to collect, visualize, and embody metadata as rich bookmarks to support ideation in 
				<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../infocomposer/index.html">InfoComposer</a> and <a href="#M7">trans-surface interaction</a>.</p>
				
			<p>The Interface Ecology Lab works on developing innovative
				multi-touch hardware, such as <a href="../research/zerotouch/index.html">ZeroTouch</a>, to embody people's
				interaction with information. This makes important developing open source software for
				connecting sensory interface hardware like ZeroTouch, with common software
				platforms. Likewise, we are using S.IM.PL and meta-metadata to develop <a href="../research/publications/kerneHamiltonToupsTransSurfaceCBDcscw2012.pdf" target="_blank" class="destination">trans-surface interaction</a>
				techniques for exchanging rich bookmarks between Android phones.</p>

			<h5>Project S1: Make Python S.IM.PL</h5>
			
            <span>contact: rhema<img src="../people/images/at.png">ecologylab.net</span>
			<p>Porting <a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../research/simplGuide/index.html">S.IM.PL</a> to Python 
			will mate Python's powerful fluid scripting with the cross-language object declaration support of S.IM.PL and meta-metadata.
			combine the rapid web app development aspects of  with the multiple platform and language agnostic features of S.IM.PL.  
			S.IM.PL Serialization is a de/serialization framework that supports information mappings across programming languages and platforms.  S.IM.PL lets developers write complex data structures (e.g. trees, hashmaps, and graphs) in annotated Java and generate equivalent de/serializable class types in C#, Objective C, and partially in Javascript.  S.IM.PL runs on Java Sun, Android, Mac OSX, and IOS.</p>

			<p>The result will be great savings in time and simplicity for developers writing distributed applications with Java, C#, or iOS clients and server-side Python / <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>.
			Writing code by hand for each programming language introduces human error and inconsistent representations between class definitions that are supposed to represent the same data.  
			In the pre-S.IM.PL world, to save or pass an instance of a type from one programming language to another, one must hand-code a de/serialization scheme that marshals each instance of a type, such that its structure can be remade.  
			Clients and servers often do not share a common programming language, so the entire process of defining the data structure and de/serialization across languages is foisted on developers.</p>

			<p>Using standard object representations across programming languages and platforms provides the interoperability required for utilizing the best aspects of a language or platform,
			without incurring the development cost of writing and maintaining the same complex data structures each time the schema changes.  
			Passing objects between platforms as serialized instances of S.IM.PL objects will provide a common context for clients, servers, and applications.
			The type definitions and JSON or XML bindings will be encapsulated in a SimplTypeScope.</p>

			<p>The student will start by implementing de/serialization of S.IM.PL objects in Python/Django.  Django models must be used because Django's database integration provides persistent storage.  
			The student will create a Python/Django code generator in Java, which will be similar to other implementations, that takes a SimpleTypeScope as input and gives Python/Django code as output.  
			The code generator will output code for adding objects into Django's administration management.  
			As in other S.IM.PL language support packages, De/serialization must be implemented for JSON and XML serialization formats.  
			The parsing in other languages will be ported.
			Testing this code will be accomplished by deserializing and serializing S.IM.PL objects from different platforms.</p>

			<p>Once S.IM/PL de/serialization and code generation is finished, the student will implement HTTP <a href="../research/simplGuide/oodss/index.html" target="blank" class="destination">OODSS</a> in Python/Django.  The Student may use the same session handling mechanisms that are implemented in Java HTTP OODSS or design another mechanism for handling sessions.  Clients accessing the server will make a request through a serialized S.IM.PL object passed as a POST parameter.  The server will send with a serialized OODSS Response object.  Non-HTTP implementations of OODSS are designed for persistent bidirectional communication include Update messages that a server may send clients (push communication).  Update messages will simulate bidirectional communication with long polling.</p>

			<p>After Python/Django OODSS is developed, the student will use S.IM.PL Python to create an interactive web app for sharing and authoring rich bookmarks as lists and grids.  The rich bookmarks will use the Metadata.js code from the M4 project to show explorable metadata over collected items.  Each rich bookmark will be represented by a picture or a text snippet and have metadata that is available for viewing on demand.  The student must use Django templates and interact with the server though asynchronous Javascript. </p>

			<p>The student should be familiar with Python, Django, Java, Javascript, HTML, jQuery, and web services.</p>

			<h5>Project M1 - Meta-Metadata C# Porting</h5>
			<img style="float: right; padding: 10px;" src="wpfMetadataComposition.png" />
            <span>contact: Zach Toups</span>
			<p>Port current meta-metadata functionalities from Java into C#,
				to support seamless cross-language and cross-platform metadata
				semantics interoperability and the creation of rich Windows applications
				built around meta-metadata. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Having meta-metadata in C# allows it to be used in native Windows frameworks such as WPF, WCF, and WinForms.
				This allows developers to create applications which can take full advantage of the Windows platform,
				including Windows 8, Windows Touch, and Windows Phone to name a few.				
			</p>
			<p>During the porting process, you will gain an understanding of how the meta-metadata system
				works, as well as interesting research and engineering problems such
				as:
				<ul>
					<li>handling complex, structured information</li>
					<li>web semantics extraction and interaction</li>
					<li>generating meaningful rich bookmarks for web pages</li>
					<li>information retrieval techniques to capture user interest</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h4>Deliverables</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>tracking document and download monitor status</li>
					<li>carrying out semantic operations (formerly semantic actions)</li>
					<li>handling the iterative extraction of metadata graph data structures
						(so that references to documents embedded in existing metadata objects
						get updated when their corresponding metadata objects are fully parsed)</li>
					<li>generating image / text clippings by traversing the DOM tree using
						our surrogate extraction algorithm</li>
					<li>creating term vectors and supporting interest expression for extracted
						metadata semantics</li>
					<li>maintenance of global document map and handling document graphs.
				The role of the global document map is to maintain a mapping from
				URLs to document metadata objects for the life of a program,
				enabling reuse of document metadata without re-parsing.</li>		
				</ul>
				
			<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
			<p>C#, Java, XML, XPath.</p>
			<p>As part of the application students will need to get familiar with meta-metadata by
				authoring a wrapper and running tests.</p>

			<h5>Project M2 - Django Information Composition Social Network</h5>
            <span>contact: rhema<img src="../people/images/at.png">ecologylab.net</span>
			<p>An information compositions is a spatially arranged set of rich bookmarks that visualizes concepts and ideas.  
			<a class="destination" href="http://www.ecologylab.net/infocomposer/" target="_blank">InfoComposer</a> is made to support the creative process of collecting, arranging, reflecting, and generating new ideas.  
			Letting users save and collaborate with compositions will help people share ideas and communicate in a flexible, visually appealing medium.</p>
			
			<p>Design an out of the box server solution for sharing <a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../research/informationComposition.html">information composition</a>s.  
			This will allow an individual or organization host a reusable, extensible, web portal application that stores information compositions and supports users in sharing and maintaining information compositions in a social network.</p>
			
			<p>The student will create a self contained web application where users upload, download, browse, share, and publish compositions authored with InfoComposer.  
			This site will also serve applications with an API for retrieval and storage of information compositions.  This constitutes cloud storage with social networking for individuals who create information compositions.  
			Saving compositions should also allow a user to add tags, which will be used for searching and browsing public information compositions.  The student will also implement an account management service using the Django admin site. 
			The student will use Django and Pinax to implement a social network where users can form groups  and publish information compositions on the web publicly, to a group, or just for themselves.</p>
			
			<p>In InfoComposer, an information composition is saved as an icom file, which is a zip compressed file that include all information about the composition.  
			This file includes a generated HTML versions of the information composition, which the social network would use to show compositions.  It also includes information about all clippings included in the composition and annotations.  
			Being able to understand and use this information will make the information composition social network better.  
			The student will use the Python implementation of S.IM.PL to help tag information compositions and provide as much information about information compositions as possible.</p>
			
			<p>The student should be familiar with Java, Python, Django
				(Templates, Database Objects, Rest responses), HTML, Javascript,
				CSS, XML, and web services. While the student should have a local
				application development environment initially. We will provide a
				virtualized environment to enable more realistic deployment
				conditions.</p>

			<h4>Deliverables</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Information Composition Social Network Site Using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" class="destination"  target="_blank">Django</a>
					and Probably <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/" target="_blank" class="destination" >Pinax</a>

			<h5>Project M3 - Semantic Service</h5>
			
            <span>contact: <a class="destination" href="../people/quyin.html" target="_blank">Yin Qu</a></span>
						<p>The semantic service will transform the wild web into well
						structured rich semantics, in the form of XML or JSON, with a
						RESTful interface, using <a target="_blank" class="destination"
							href="../research/simplGuide/metaMetadata/index.html">meta-metadata</a>.
						Rich semantics will be directly mapped to classes and instances in
						programming languages including Java and C# for convenient use. The
						semantic service is critical for building thin clients (web-based,
						Android or desktop) working with rich semantics from multiple
						sources, such as a web site mixing all your social network
						activities; an application allowing you to collect rich bookmarks
						(see the figure; check out <a target="_blank" class="destination"
							href="../infocomposer/">InfoComposer</a>); a mobile app that you
						can share rich bookmarks with annotations to your family or
						friends, or even social networks.</p>

			<p>The semantic service will store complex <i>metadata semantics</i> in a
			distributed database back-end, and communicate with clients through HTTP.
			SIMPL <a class="destination"
				href="../research/simplGuide/oodss/index.html"
				target="blank">OODSS</a> over HTTP, an easy-to-use web service
			framework, will simplify the implementation, by using <a
				class="destination"
				href="../research/simplGuide/serialization/index.html"
				target="blank">S.IM.PL Serialization</a> on information and message
			data structures.  However, rich semantics also brings unusual challenges:
			storing complex metadata semantics into a database back-end (we are
			primarily focusing on PostgreSQL for now) results in large number of
			tables and performance issues; the messy nature of semantics in the real
			world requires dealing with cross references both in memory and in
			database; we must survive schema evolution along with changes in the
			wrapper repository, and maintain high performance through distributed,
			fault-tolerant data stores and caches.</p>

			<p>In GSoC 2011, an Object-Relational Mapping module has been
			implemented, connecting metadata semantics with databases. This year,
			building on previous work, the student will put components together and
			finally kick off the service! The student will work with the mentor to
			design the service interface, create testings, deploy the service, code
			simple maintenance tools, and deal with aforementioned challenges. The
			student will learn about and experience web semantics, RESTful web
			services, distributed storage and processing, among other exciting
			techniques that are related to complex big data, and participate in
			cutting edge research. We will provide access to a virtualized
			environment on a many-core server that we have.</p>

			<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
			<p>Java, XML/JSON, SQL (ideally PostgreSQL), HTTP. Experiences with web
				sites, services, Ehcache/memcached, and distributed systems will be a plus.</p>

			<h4>Deliverables</h4>
			<p>The specific scope of work may be adjusted according to the student's
			experiences. A minimum set of deliverables includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Service API design.</li>
				<li>Semantics extraction as a service.</li>
				<li>Middle layer between semantics extraction service and current ORM layer.</li>
				<li>Basic scripts for testing and deployment.</li>
				<li>Basic administration / log viewing portal.</li>
				<li>Basic schema evolution tool.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Optional deliverables:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Caches.</li>
				<li>Replications.</li>
				<li>Search service.</li>

			<h5>Project M4: Interactive Metadata Browser Extension and
				Mashup</h5>
                <span>contact: <a class="destination" href="../people/andrew.html" target="_blank">Andrew Webb</a></span>
			<p>This project seeks to help Google Chrome users better explore the web and improve the
				value of mashups by providing
				metadata about linked documents. The student will build a Chrome extension for interactive
				visualization and browsing of metadata as HTML5. For the general use
				case, the extension will display metadata associated with linked
				documents when the user brushes her mouse over hyperlinks. The
				extension will build on existing Javascript extraction that uses
				<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../research/simplGuide/metaMetadata/index.html">meta-metadata</a> JSON objects to extract metadata as JSON and present
				the metadata through javascript injection.</p>
				
				<p>The idea is to bring <a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../infocomposer/index.html">InfoComposer</a>'s treatment of rich bookmarks into HTML5!
				Launch InfoComposer, drag an image from Amazon from Firefox into an empty 
				<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../research/informationComposition.html">information composition</a>, 
				and see what we mean :).</p>

			<p>The student will be responsible for designing structures,
				interactions, and visual styling (CSS3) of the metadata browser. A
				clean, space efficient, visualization is important. The student will
				need to create a design that mitigates difficulties inherent in
				displaying metadata that include large tree structures, cyclic
				graphs and lengthy text fields.</p>

			<p>One deliverable is to develop an exciting use case involving
				mashups, including authoring new meta-metadata wrappers as needed.
				The student will use existing open source mashup and visualization
				tools, such as OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, and SIMILE. This use
				case will enable users to quickly create mashups from collected
				metadata.</p>

			<P>Examples of possible mashup use cases are:
			<ul>
				<li>Use geolocational information from sites like Urban Spoon,
					anchoring meal cost, environment, and reviews to physical locations
					relevant to the user embedded in a Google Map.</li>
				<li>Visualize documents and metadata organized by temporal
					information using SIMILE timeline widget.</li>
			</ul>
			</P>

			<h4>Deliverables</h4>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Metadata browser Chrome extension</li>
				<li>New meta-metadata wrappers for mashup</li>
				<li>Mashup use case</li>
				<li>Documentation and tutorial</li>

			<h5>Project M7: Trans-surface Metadata Message Passing with NFC</h5>
			<p>The Object-Oriented Distributed Semantic Services (<a href="../research/simplGuide/oodss/index.html" target="blank">OODSS</a>)
				framework supports developers in defining web services easily by
				enabling them to specify the data sent over the wire, its serialized
				form, and the operations upon it together in one place. Near Field
				Communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones and
				similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by
				touching them together or bringing them into close proximity. Mobile
				phones equipped with NFC chips can send <a href="../research/simplGuide/oodss/index.html" target="blank">OODSS</a> messages to each other
				and also to PCs or other devices with NFC. NFC wraps the message
				into NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF). There are four different types
				of NFC tags in NDEF. This project will develop libraries for
				wrapping, sending, receiving, interpreting NFC messages from <a href="../research/simplGuide/oodss/index.html" target="blank">OODSS</a>
				messages targeting various programming platforms including Android,
				Windows phone 8 (in the future), and PC/Mac (Java, .NET,
				Objective-C, etc.) through USB connected NFC chip.</p>

			<p>Enabling the trans-surface transfer of messages, such as rich
				bookmarks, across different devices can support a collaborative
				working environment. Information composition is a holistic form for
				representing collections and to support ideation. Image and text
				clippings from web pages function as visual, semiotic, and
				navigational surrogates (rich bookmarks) for significant ideas.
				compositions are formed by collecting rich bookmarks , which are
				generated by <a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../research/simplGuide/metaMetadata/index.html">meta-metadata</a>. Meta-metadata is an open source
				framework addressing problems associated with supporting metadata
				semantics for diverse information sources. Mobile devices usually
				have access to mobile versions of websites that are different from
				normal desktop version of the sites. Thus, the student will author
				meta-metadata wrappers for these website,versions.</p>

			<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

			<p>Familiarity with XML and multiple languages, including Java,
				C, .NET, Objective-C is recommended. Previous experience with mobile
				devices development is a plus. The student must state in the
				application which devices and platforms s/he has available for
				development.</p>

			<h4>Deliverables</h4>
			<p>The student will be responsible for becoming familiar with
				S.IM.PL framework and <a href="../research/simplGuide/oodss/index.html" target="blank" class="destination">OODSS</a>. S/he will then develop high-level
				Windows, Mac, and Java APIs to support application developers
				developing software across phones, tablets and PCs, using NFC to
				communicate. Will work with the mentor and other people who are
				developing applications that potentially use NFC to communicate. The
				student and the mentor will also identify websites targeting mobile
				devices that are of particular interest. The student will author
				wrappers for these web sites. With the completion of each wrapper,
				the mentor will inspect the work and provide feedback.</p>

<!--         <span>contact: <a class="destination" href="../people/nabeel.html" target="_blank">Nabeel Shahzad</a></span> -->
<!-- 		<p>C++ is an important ANSI/ISO standard object-oriented programming language.  -->
<!-- 		Making C++ <a href="../research/simplGuide/index.html" target="blank" class="destination">S.IM.PL</a> will facilitate developing distributed programs,  -->
<!-- 		for example connecting Java and C++ server components that need to exchange complex data, but live in separate processes. -->
<!-- 		C++'s STL supports complex de/serialization of object graphs, but without the fine-grained control S.IM.PL provides, or -->
<!-- 		the ability to automatically generate equivalent object definitions and exchange object-oriented data with programs in Java, C#, and Objective C. -->
<!-- 		</p> -->
<!-- 		<p> -->
<!-- 		The C++ S.IM.PL port presents some interesting challenges to the programmer, because C++ will be the first S.IM.PL language that lacks reflection. -->
<!-- 		This means instead of using optimized reflection at runtime for serialization, code must be generated for serializing each class. -->
<!-- 		The structure of the generated code will be similar to that currently employed during runtime. -->
<!-- 		The new abstraction layer will likely employ <a href="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ST4/Introduction" target="_blank">ANTLR StringTemplate</a>. -->

<!-- 			<h4>Deliverables</h4> -->
<!-- 			<li>A Java program, part of the simplTranslators project, which will generate C++ class representations from S.IM.PL <code>ClassDescriptor</code>s. Generated code will include  -->
<!-- 			<a href="../research/simplGuide/serialization/index.html" target="_blank" class="destination">serialization and deserialization</a> methods.  -->
<!-- 			</li> -->
<!-- 			<li>Serialization methods in generated C++ classes. Output formats for objects will include XML and JSON. Serialized objects will be compatible with S.IM.PL serialization in Java, C#, and Objective C.</li> -->

		<h5>T1: TUIO Windows Touch Driver</h5>
        <span>contact: <a class="destination" href="../people/bill.html" target="_blank">Bill Hamilton</a></span>
		<p>Design and implement a Windows 7 and 8 application which
			converts incoming TUIO (http://www.tuio.org/) events into Windows
			touch events.</p>

		<p>Currently the only available TUIO to Windows touch bridge
			application is Multi-Touch Vista
			(http://multitouchvista.codeplex.com/). This application is difficult
			to use, does not support multiple monitor setups, and contains bugs
			and memory leaks. The goal of this project is to create an
			application similar to the (only partially open source) Multi-Touch
			Vista, but better designed, more robust, and feature complete.</p>

		<p>Required features of the application: able to listen for TUIO
			events and convert them to driver level Windows touch events, stable,
			and easy to install and run. The application should be free of memory
			leaks and should not output ghost touch events.</p>
		<p>Other desired features include: having the application in the
			Windows system-tray so configuration options can be viewed and
			modified, supporting multiple monitors and multiple incoming TUIO
			ports, and options to disable and emulate stylus events. Future work,
			as these platforms enable support for multiple monitors and touch
			events, will build compatible functionality for Android and Apple.</p>
		<p>The student should begin by learning about Multi-Touch Vista,
			Windows 7/8 touch events, and TUIO messages. Then, formulate a design
			and implementation plan. The final application should include
			adequate documentation, so that it can be easily utilized and
			distributed.</p>
		<p>The desired student should have experience creating Windows
			drivers. The student should also be familiar with TUIO and OSC.
			Ideally, the student will have a touch-enabled Windows device. The
			Java TUIO-based simulator will in any case be utilized.</p>

				the project, why you are interested, and what you believe to be the
				expected benefits to the open-source community.</p>
			<h4>Deliverables and Timeline</h4>
			<p>In roughly a page of text, breakdown your selected project
				into a set of milestones or deliverables and set realistic
				timetables for accomplishing these deliverables. Include a GANTT
				chart showing your planned progress over the summer. Explain the
				deliverables that are "must-haves", as well as expanding on future
				work that you may or may not accomplish, time permitting. Keep in
				mind that some things may take longer than you originally
				anticipated, so be sure and include contingency plans for such
				circumstances. This is the heart of your proposal.</p>
			<h4>Communication</h4>
			<p>Write a short paragraph detailing how you plan on keeping in
				communication with your project mentor and ensuring that your
				deliverables are on time. Will you have weekly Skype meetings? Is
				email your preferred method of communication? How do you plan to
				keep us informed of both progress as well as problems?</p>
			<h4>Code Sample URL</h4>
			<p>For projects M1-M7, the code sample is a meta-metadata wrapper that you have authored, along with an example URL that extracts metadata from it.
			Present a web page that links to the wrapper XML, any newly generated Java classes, and one or more input URL / output xml pairs.</p>
		<p>For projects S1 and S2, write a small test program in Java or C# that uses S.IM.PL Serialization's Data Binding Annotation Language to serialize and deserialize some complex data structure.
			In order to show that you understand S.IM.PL's power, ideally, this will be a graph-like structure, with cycles. It will also use composite objects, collections, and polymorphism.
			Again, present a web page with links to the source file, and its output in one or more test cases.</p>

			<p>Anything else that you want to let us know about yourself,
				about the project, or any other information you think would help
				your application should be included as well. This includes other
				projects you may have worked on, code samples you are particularly
				proud of, academic publications, your personal blog, software
				development experience, education, etc. Remember, you are trying to
				sell yourself as the right person for the job! Anything that would
				help convice us of that should be in your application, including its associated web pages.</p>

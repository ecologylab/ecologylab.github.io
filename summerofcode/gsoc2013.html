			<h1>Summer of Code at the Interface Ecology Lab!</h1>

			<p>
            The Interface Ecology Lab is a supportive community of developers
            dedicated to human-centered computing, object-oriented design, and
            open source software. We are engaged in cutting-edge research that 
            <a target="_blank" class="destination"
            href="../infocomposer/index.html">visualizes and embodies social and
            semantic information</a>, with multi-touch interaction, for use in
            games, creativity support tools, interactive art, and other digital
						media. <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013" target="_blank" class="destination">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> Internships enable students located anywhere
            to collaborate with us in developing open source software.

			BigSemantics is a language and architecture for defining, extracting,
			manipulating, exchanging, and presenting semantic data (<i>metadata</i>) in
			desktop, mobile, and cloud applications.
			With BigSemantics, developers author application-independent, reusable code
			blocks in the <i>meta-metadata</i> language, which are called
			<i>wrappers</i>, to specify data models, extraction rules, presentation
			rules, and semantic actions for metadata.
		    The architecture allows you to easily obtain structural semantic data from
		    many template-based web sites, and conveniently operate on semantic data
		    through native classes and objects.
		    It comes with a large, yet growing repository of wrappers, supporting a
		    wide range of commonly used web sites and services, such as weather
		    forecasts, Google Books, Amazon Products, games, movies, blog posts, RSS,
		    tweets, and pinboards.
			We are working on supporting more and more web sites and information types.
			Checkout <a class="destination" target="_blank"

        Working across multiple programming languages is often a painful
        experience. De/Serialization of data across languages often requires
        lengthy boilerplate code prone to failures. Serialization of graphs and
        cycles is often impossible or hard to accomplish. Additionally, it is
        radically hard to port software and validate that those ports work
        correctly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <i>Fortunately, it doesn't have stay this way.</i> <a href="../simpl"
        class="destination">S.IM.PL</a> (Support for Information Mapping between
        Programming Languages) is an architecture that promises to fix these
        problems; we'd love to hire a developer to help us implement it in
        JavaScript. Our lab uses S.IM.PL as the foundation for some of our
        research projects; when you're done implementing it, you'll be able to
        use it as a foundation for your own projects!
        </p>

        <p>
        S.IM.PL is an architecture that aims to let developers simply transfer
        information between programming languages. (Ideally with no muss, no
        fuss, and little boilerplate!)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Implementing S.IM.PL in JavaScript also moves us closer to realizing
        some of the potential of S.IM.PL. Consider this: web services
        implemented in dynamic languages (Python, Ruby, JavaScript on Node, etc)
        can often be less performant than versions written in less dynamic
        languages (C++, Go, etc.) <a
        href="http://blog.iron.io/2013/03/how-we-went-from-30-servers-to-2-go.html"
        class="destination">A recent blog post</a> mentioned how one organiation
        went from 30 servers running rails to 2 running Go to service their API.
        A cross language type system can help make these sorts of transitions
        painless! Plus, you can leverage all of the investments made in testing
        and validation across all language-implementations of a tool or service!
        </p>

        <p>
        Similar projects exist in this space, such as <a
        href="http://thrift.apache.org/" class="destination">Apache Thrift</a>
        and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/"
        class="destination">Google Protobuf</a>. What makes us different is a
        strong dedication to ease-of-reimplementation, a focus on human-readable
        formats (even though binary formats will be supported in the future),
        and desire to reduce developer work as much as possible. Leveraging
        Thrift and Protobuf requires writing boilerplate to conform to Message
        or Service specs; Why rewrite data structures when they can be
        translated with S.IM.PL?
        </p>

        <p>
        At the end of this project, you could presumably take any web/server
        application designed in JavaScript and port it to another language of
        your choosing. (Do you have a Node server that isn't performant enough?
        If only there was some way you could offload the logic to another
        language... With S.IM.PL, That can be a reality.)
        </p>

        <p>
        We are looking for developers that can see the promise of S.IM.PL (as a
        tool for making software development across languages s.im.pl.y
        awesome), are dedicated to good coding practices (Testing, refactoring,
        clarity, etc), and ideally could find a use for S.IM.PL in their own
        personal projects. Experience with Java isn't a nescessity, although it
        will help you understand the reference implementation of S.IM.PL better.

        Through the course of this project, you will develop a JavaScript-based
        implementation of S.IM.PL.  You'll be able to follow many of the
        patterns from the reference implementation of S.IM.PL. Your
        implementation, of course, will also include a robust suite of tests to
        validate its correctness! Additionally, you'll work on combining S.IM.PL
        with some of our other tools, such as BigSemantics, to help validate and
        improve the value of your implementation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Some of these use S.IM.PL-specific terminology, feel free to read our

        The architecture has a decent number of small pieces that, once all
        implemented, give you a complete, robust cross-language type system.
        We'll help you through the entire process! All you need to provide are
        your skills (an understanding of type systems, Javascript, and a bit of
        Java knowledge to understand the reference implementation), and your
        desire to develop! For more questions, contact us on IRC (#ecologylab on

          <h3>M1: Managing Web Semantics in JavaScript</h3>
        </a>

        <p>Mentor: <a href="../people/nic.html">Nic Lupfer</a></p>

        <p>
          The Managing Web Semantics in JavaScript project focuses on
          extracting, understanding, and visualizing web semantics(metadata)
          within a web applications or browser plugins. The deliverables of this
          project are centered around increasing the stability, functionality,
          and interoperability of the <a class="destination" target="_blank"
          href="https://github.com/ecologylab/BigSemanticsJavaScript/tree/master/metadataExtractor">Metadata
          Extractor</a> browser plugin and the <a class="destination" target="_blank"
          href="http://ecologylab.net/ice">In-Context
          Expander (ICE)</a> dynamic interface in HTML5.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Metadata Extractor is a browser plugin which parses the DOM of web
          pages as your browse to extract metadata using the BigSemantics <a class="destination" target="_blank"
          href="https://github.com/ecologylab/BigSemantics/wiki">meta-metadata
          language</a>. Currently available for Chrome and Firefox the plugin
          exposes the extracted metadata to other web or desktop applications
          through HTML5 data injection on <a class="destination" target="_blank"
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/dnd.html">DataTransfer
          events</a>.
        </p>

        <p>ICE is a dynamic interface which renders web semantics in HTML5. The interface allows
          for users to browse and navigate to linked web semantics. The student will design and
          create new dynamic interfaces. Different dynamic interfaces will share significant
          implementation with ICE but should be novel in how they visualize the data and how the
          user navigates to connected web semantics.</p>

          <h3>M2: BigSemantics: Curation of Popular Culture</h3>
        </a>
        <p>Mentor: <a href="../people/andruid.html">Andruid Kerne</a></p>

        <p>This project develops popular perspectives in web semantics in order to involve the
          general public, especially young people, in new experiences of collecting, presenting, and
          sharing information. Curation is the process of developing a conceptual focus, and
          selecting and connecting significant information that expresses the chosen concepts. Each
          REU student assigned to this project will identify a cultural area significant to her /
          him, and work on the curation of semantic information in this area. Examples of potential
          popular culture areas include fashion, sports, music, entertainment, skateboarding, DIY,
          crafts, design, and dance.</p>

        <p>
          The goal of this semantics curation is to make information in these popular culture areas
          available to people in new ways, to catalyze new expressions, uses, and communities
          involving the information. Curating semantics involves identifying cultural areas of
          information on the web that matter to particular groups of people, defining data
          structures to best represent this information, identifying template-driven web sites that
          publish data that can be used to instantiate the data structures, and defining XPath and
          regular expressions that extract information from the web sites. This
          involves using the Interface Ecology Lab's open source <a
          class="destination" target="_blank"
          href="https://github.com/ecologylab/BigSemantics/wiki">BigSemantics
          toolkit</a> and <a class="destination" target="_blank"
          href="http://ecologylab.net/ice">ICE presentation tool</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The project involves using social media to coalesce user communities around new
          visual semantic presentations in the area of popular culture that the student curates.</p>

        <p>More than one student can work on this project, assuming that each works on a
          different area of popular culture. These areas and their associated students can
          fruitfully intersect.</p>

        </a>
        <p>Mentor: <a href="../people/andruid.html">Andruid Kerne</a></p>

        <p>We need methods to facilitate presenting rich heterogeneous metadata on maps. Rich
          metadata consists of descriptions and relational associative links, derived from web
          pages, such as a movie, its actors and their movies, and a historical site, its
          significant events and artifacts, and other related events, sites, and artifacts.</p>

        <p>
          The Interface Ecology Lab's open source BigSemantics project has developed tools for
          wrappers that represent the data models for rich metadata, extraction rules for particular
          web sites and other sources, and hints for presentation. A repository of wrappers covers
          many popular web sites. BigSemantics also already includes components for presenting this
          rich metadata in JavaScript, Java, and C# / WinRT. The <a class="destination" target="_blank"
            href="http://ecologylab.net/ice">ICE presentation tool</a> is an example.
        </p>

        <p>This project will develop tools and examples for representing rich metadata
          instances, each associated with a GPS location, on maps, to be known as rich placemarks.
          The instances of metadata for places that go on the map could be curated in advance, or
          collected ad hoc by drag and drop. This will be accomplished by integrating BigSemantics,
          ICE, and OpenStreetMaps (and perhaps Google Maps).</p>

          <li>Develop an integration of OpenStreetMaps and ICE, which enables interaction with

          <h3>M4: Scaling BigSemantics Service with CouchDB</h3>
        </a>
        <p>Mentor: <a href="../people/quyin.html">Yin Qu</a></p>

        <p>
        This project develops a scalable data storage and indexing backend for
        the BigSemantics service. The Interface Ecology Lab developed the
        BigSemantics service as open source software to support extracting,
        representing and presenting semantic data on the web in desktop, mobile,
        and cloud applications (<a target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/ecologylab/BigSemanticsService/wiki"
        class="destination">BigSemantics Wiki</a>). The developed system will
        provide the service with a scalable backend to store accessed web pages
        and extracted semantic data, to improve performance. It will also
        automatically construct indexes and aggregations on relevant fields. The
        storage and indexing backend will support critical interactions with
        semantic data needed for planning and doing disaster response, such as
        filtering, searching, ranking, and faceted browsing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The student assigned to this project will need to build on existing
        techniques to develop the system and connect it to the BigSemantics
        service, under guidance. This involves learning the code structures and
        APIs of BigSemantics and the service project developed by the Interface
        Ecology Lab, designing proper interfaces and APIs to abstract the new
        module, and invoking the backend data store like CouchDB when needed by
        the service. By the end of the summer, the student should develop a demo
        web application that uses the storage and indexing functionalities, as a
        validation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The Interface Ecology Lab will provide a virtual Linux environment for
        the student to develop this server-side system. The resulting software
        will be included in the BigSemantics service release, available to the
        public as open source software.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The student will learn the architecture and implementation of modern
        web-based services, and the use of services in advanced interaction
        technologies. S/he will work in a team of active developers and
        researchers, participate in conversations, and involve in the process of
        producing open source software.

						<p>The semantic service will transform the wild web into well
						structured rich semantics, in the form of XML or JSON, with a
						RESTful interface, using <a target="_blank" class="destination"
							href="../research/simplGuide/metaMetadata/index.html">meta-metadata</a>.
						Rich semantics will be directly mapped to classes and instances in
						programming languages including Java and C# for convenient use. The
						semantic service is critical for building thin clients (web-based,
						Android or desktop) working with rich semantics from multiple
						sources, such as a web site mixing all your social network
						activities; an application allowing you to collect rich bookmarks
						(see the figure; check out <a target="_blank" class="destination"
							href="../infocomposer/">InfoComposer</a>); a mobile app that you
						can share rich bookmarks with annotations to your family or
						friends, or even social networks.</p>

			<p>The semantic service will store complex <i>metadata semantics</i> in a
			distributed database back-end, and communicate with clients through HTTP.
			SIMPL <a class="destination"
				href="../research/simplGuide/oodss/index.html"
				target="blank">OODSS</a> over HTTP, an easy-to-use web service
			framework, will simplify the implementation, by using <a
				class="destination"
				href="../research/simplGuide/serialization/index.html"
				target="blank">S.IM.PL Serialization</a> on information and message
			data structures.  However, rich semantics also brings unusual challenges:
			storing complex metadata semantics into a database back-end (we are
			primarily focusing on PostgreSQL for now) results in large number of
			tables and performance issues; the messy nature of semantics in the real
			world requires dealing with cross references both in memory and in
			database; we must survive schema evolution along with changes in the
			wrapper repository, and maintain high performance through distributed,
			fault-tolerant data stores and caches.</p>

			<p>In GSoC 2011, an Object-Relational Mapping module has been
			implemented, connecting metadata semantics with databases. This year,
			building on previous work, the student will put components together and
			finally kick off the service! The student will work with the mentor to
			design the service interface, create testings, deploy the service, code
			simple maintenance tools, and deal with aforementioned challenges. The
			student will learn about and experience web semantics, RESTful web
			services, distributed storage and processing, among other exciting
			techniques that are related to complex big data, and participate in
			cutting edge research. We will provide access to a virtualized
			environment on a many-core server that we have.</p>

			<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
			<p>Java, XML/JSON, SQL (ideally PostgreSQL), HTTP. Experiences with web
				sites, services, Ehcache/memcached, and distributed systems will be a plus.</p>

			<h4>Deliverables</h4>
			<p>The specific scope of work may be adjusted according to the student's
			experiences. A minimum set of deliverables includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Service API design.</li>
				<li>Semantics extraction as a service.</li>
				<li>Middle layer between semantics extraction service and current ORM layer.</li>
				<li>Basic scripts for testing and deployment.</li>

		<h5>T1: TUIO Windows Touch Driver</h5>
        <span>contact: <a class="destination" href="../people/bill.html" target="_blank">Bill Hamilton</a></span>
		<p>Design and implement a Windows 7 and 8 application which
			converts incoming TUIO (http://www.tuio.org/) events into Windows
			touch events.</p>

		<p>Currently the only available TUIO to Windows touch bridge
			application is Multi-Touch Vista
			(http://multitouchvista.codeplex.com/). This application is difficult
			to use, does not support multiple monitor setups, and contains bugs
			and memory leaks. The goal of this project is to create an
			application similar to the (only partially open source) Multi-Touch
			Vista, but better designed, more robust, and feature complete.</p>

		<p>Required features of the application: able to listen for TUIO
			events and convert them to driver level Windows touch events, stable,
			and easy to install and run. The application should be free of memory
			leaks and should not output ghost touch events.</p>
		<p>Other desired features include: having the application in the
			Windows system-tray so configuration options can be viewed and
			modified, supporting multiple monitors and multiple incoming TUIO
			ports, and options to disable and emulate stylus events. Future work,
			as these platforms enable support for multiple monitors and touch
			events, will build compatible functionality for Android and Apple.</p>
		<p>The student should begin by learning about Multi-Touch Vista,
			Windows 7/8 touch events, and TUIO messages. Then, formulate a design
			and implementation plan. The final application should include
			adequate documentation, so that it can be easily utilized and
			distributed.</p>
		<p>The desired student should have experience creating Windows
			drivers. The student should also be familiar with TUIO and OSC.
			Ideally, the student will have a touch-enabled Windows device. The
			Java TUIO-based simulator will in any case be utilized.</p>

            circumstances. This is the heart of your proposal.</p>
          <h4>Communication</h4>
          <p>Write a short paragraph detailing how you plan on keeping in communication with
            your project mentor and ensuring that your deliverables are on time. Will you have
            weekly Skype meetings? Is email your preferred method of communication? How do you plan
            to keep us informed of both progress as well as problems?</p>
            
          <h4>Code Sample</h4>
          <p>
          For each project, please share us a programming project or pieces of programming work
          that you have done before.
          For example, a GitHub or Google Code project that you have done for
          your class, or links to patches you submitted to open source project(s).
          The project or code sample will be used solely for us to evaluate your
          programming skills.
          </p>
          <p>
          For projects M1-M5, you should also submit a meta-metadata wrapper
          that you have authored, along with an exmaple URL that extracts
          metadata from it.
          You should author the wrapper by forking the <a
          href="https://github.com/ecologylab/BigSemanticsWrapperRepository"

          <p>For projects S1 and S2, write a small test program in Java or C# that uses S.IM.PL
            Serialization's Data Binding Annotation Language to serialize and deserialize some
            complex data structure. In order to show that you understand S.IM.PL's power, ideally,
            this will be a graph-like structure, with cycles. It will also use composite objects,
            collections, and polymorphism. Again, present a web page with links to the source file,
            and its output in one or more test cases.</p>
          -->
          
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>Anything else that you want to let us know about yourself, about the project, or
            any other information you think would help your application should be included as well.
            This includes other projects you may have worked on, code samples you are particularly
            proud of, academic publications, your personal blog, software development experience,
            education, etc. Remember, you are trying to sell yourself as the right person for the

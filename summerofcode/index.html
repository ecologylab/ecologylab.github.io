			BigSemantics is a language and architecture for defining, extracting,
			manipulating, exchanging, and presenting semantic data (<i>metadata</i>) in
			desktop, mobile, and cloud applications.
			With BigSemantics, developers author application-independent, reusable code
			blocks in the <i>meta-metadata</i> language, which are called
			<i>wrappers</i>, to specify data models, extraction rules, presentation
			rules, and semantic actions for metadata.
		    The architecture allows you to easily obtain structural semantic data from
		    many template-based web sites, and conveniently operate on semantic data
		    through native classes and objects.
		    It comes with a large, yet growing repository of wrappers, supporting a
		    wide range of commonly used web sites and services, such as weather
		    forecasts, Google Books, Amazon Products, games, movies, blog posts, RSS,
		    tweets, and pinboards.
			We are working on supporting more and more web sites and information types.

          <h3>M1: Content-based Extraction for BigSemantics</h3>
        </a>

        <p>Mentor: <a target="_blank" href="../people/quyin.html">Yin Qu</a></p>

        <p>
          This project will enhance BigSemantics with functionalities to deal
          with complex semantics that involve multiple, variate types, based on
          the page content. To
          support extraction and presentation of such semantics, multiple
          enhancements are needed to BigSemantics core features:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>I. Wrapper selection based on page elements.</b> BigSemantics uses
          wrappers to specify how semantics should be extracted and presented.
          Each wrapper corresponds to not only one, but a family of web pages
          that contain semantics of a certain category, or type, such as a book,
          a movie, or a technology product. Currently, for an input web page,
          BigSemantics will automatically select the most appropriate wrapper in
          order to extract and present semantics of that type. This selection is
          based on URL pattern, suffix, and MIME types.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, from experiences we found that in many cases, determining the
          real type of a web page requires inspecting its content, such as
          looking for a specific element with certain values. In this subaim,
          you will enhance BigSemantics’ selection mechanism, to be able to
          determine or refine the type of a web page by inspecting specific
          elements and their values.
        </p>

        <p>
          II. Extraction of mixins. In some other cases, we need to combine
          semantics of different type in one metadata object dynamically based
          on the content of the page, such as a book for selling (which will
          involve product semantics), or an image with EXIF information. This
          can be done through mixins. BigSemantics supports mixins in metadata
          objects, however, we need to enhance the extraction module to be able
          to extract mixin objects. The type of the object will be determined
          again by inspecting the page content.
        </p>

        <p>
          The two enhancements need to work together to address complex
          semantics. For example, for a Wikipedia page describing a movie star,
          we want to extract movie star semantics based on the page content, and
          mix in Wikipedia specific semantics, such as links to related
          Wikipedia articles.
        </p>

          <h3>M2: BigSemantics: Curation of Popular Culture</h3>
        </a>
        <p>Mentor: <a target="_blank" href="../people/nic.html">Nic Lupfer</a></p>

        <p>This project develops popular perspectives in web semantics in order to involve the
          general public, especially young people, in new experiences of collecting, presenting, and
          sharing information. Curation is the process of developing a conceptual focus, and
          selecting and connecting significant information that expresses the chosen concepts. Each
          REU student assigned to this project will identify a cultural area significant to her /
          him, and work on the curation of semantic information in this area. Examples of potential
          popular culture areas include fashion, sports, music, entertainment, skateboarding, DIY,
          crafts, design, and dance.</p>

        <p>
          The goal of this semantics curation is to make information in these popular culture areas
          available to people in new ways, to catalyze new expressions, uses, and communities
          involving the information. Curating semantics involves identifying cultural areas of
          information on the web that matter to particular groups of people, defining data
          structures to best represent this information, identifying template-driven web sites that
          publish data that can be used to instantiate the data structures, and defining XPath and
          regular expressions that extract information from the web sites. This
          involves using the Interface Ecology Lab's open source <a
          class="destination" target="_blank"
          href="https://github.com/ecologylab/BigSemantics/wiki">BigSemantics
          toolkit</a> and <a class="destination" target="_blank"
          href="http://ecologylab.net/mice">MICE</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The project involves using social media to coalesce user communities around new
          visual semantic presentations in the area of popular culture that the student curates.</p>

        <p>More than one student can work on this project, assuming that each works on a
          different area of popular culture. These areas and their associated students can
          fruitfully intersect.</p>

        <h4>Deliverables:</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Develop reusable semantic data models for areas of popular culture, using
            Meta-Metadata.</li>
          <li>Develop selectors and wrappers for specific web sites.</li>
          <li>Build fun tutorial applicationsl / demo in DHTML incorporating MICE and popular
            culture.</li>
          <li>Alternative dynamic metadata visualizations using <a
            class="destination" target="_blank" href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>.</li>
          <li>Produce clear documentation in the BigSemantics Wiki.</li>

          <h3>M3: Rich Placemarks</h3>
        </a>
        <p>Mentor: <a target="_blank" href="../people/andruid.html">Andruid Kerne</a></p>

        <p>We need methods to facilitate presenting rich heterogeneous metadata on maps. Rich
          metadata consists of descriptions and relational associative links, derived from web
          pages, such as a movie, its actors and their movies, and a historical site, its
          significant events and artifacts, and other related events, sites, and artifacts.</p>

        <p>
          The Interface Ecology Lab's open source BigSemantics project has developed tools for
          wrappers that represent the data models for rich metadata, extraction rules for particular
          web sites and other sources, and hints for presentation. A repository of wrappers covers
          many popular web sites. BigSemantics also already includes components for presenting this
          rich metadata in JavaScript, Java, and C# / WinRT. The <a class="destination" target="_blank"
            href="http://ecologylab.net/mice">MICE</a> is an example.
        </p>

        <p>This project will develop tools and examples for representing rich metadata
          instances, each associated with a GPS location, on maps, to be known as rich placemarks.
          The instances of metadata for places that go on the map could be curated in advance, or
          collected ad hoc by drag and drop. This will be accomplished by integrating BigSemantics,
          MICE, and OpenStreetMaps (and perhaps Google Maps).</p>

        <h4>Deliverables:</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Extend and develop reusable semantic data models for places, using Meta-Metadata.</li>
          <li>Develop selectors and wrappers for specific web sites that present mappable
            locations.</li>
          <li>Develop an integration of OpenStreetMaps and MICE, which enables interaction with
            rich place-oriented metadata on a map.</li>
          <li>Build fun tutorial / demo applications in DHTML incorporating MICE with popular
            culture, such as mashups involving TripAdvisor, Expedia, and WIkipedia.</li>
          <li>Produce clear documentation in the BigSemantics and MICE Wikis.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The developer needs experience with HTML5, JSON, and interaction design. Source code
          is organized with Git.</p>

          <h3>M4: Building Dynamic Exploratory Browsing Interfaces</h3>
        </a>
        <p>Mentor: <a target="_blank" href="../people/quyin.html">Yin Qu</a></p>

        <p>
          In this project, you will design and implement new interfaces for
          visualizing and interacting with web semantics within web applications
          and web pages, which we call dynamic exploratory browsing interfaces
          (DEBIs). The goal of DEBIs is to change how people interact with and
          interpret the vast amount of information accessible in today’s
          Internet age. An initial example is MICE, which supports browsing in
          one context and reduces switching windows or tabs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The deliverables of this project are centered around creating new
          DEBIs according to the paradigm of MICE. New DEBIs will use the same
          underlying open-source frameworks BigSemantics and
          BigSemanticsJavaScript. BigSemantics provides rich metadata for web
          pages. BigSemanticsJavaScript provides functions for retrieving,
          deserializing, iterating across, displaying, and interacting with
          metadata. In addition, new DEBIs will build upon the open source
          visualization framework, <a class="destination" target="_blank"
            href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>, and will be incorporated as a part of
          BigSemanticsJavaScript. Along with designing and building new DEBIs,
          this projects involves iterating on the architecture of the
          BigSemanticsJavaScript framework, including developing a DEBI testing
          platform.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          By the end of the summer, the developer working on this project will
          have created 2 new, innovative HTML5 exploratory browsing interfaces
          and a testing platform for the BigSemanticsJavaScript framework.

        </a>
        <p>Mentor: <a target="_blank" href="../people/andrew.html">Andrew Webb</a></p>

        <p>
          BigSemantics provides a compiler that translates wrappers, written in
          the meta-metadata language, into classes in programming languages such
          as Java and C#, so that applications can conveniently access and use
          semantic information as native objects.
        </p>

        <p>
          The meta-metadata language supports generics. For example, the type
          search has a generic type parameter for its search results. Subtypes
          can specialize that generic type parameter to specify a search for a
          particular type (Search&lt;ResultType&gt;), such as a search for Google

        <p>
          Currently, the meta-metadata compiler that generates C# code doesn’t
          handle generics correctly. Specifically, it doesn’t handle covariance,
          which means recognizing that Search&lt;GoogleBook&gt; is a subtype of
          Search&lt;Book&gt;. In C#, covariance is handled through interfaces instead
          of concrete classes. Therefore, to deal with covariance, the compiler
          needs to generate not only the concrete class, but also the interface
          containing covariance information.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this project, you will develop this feature of generating C#
          generics and covariance interfaces from meta-metadata wrappers. You
          will learn about how type systems work in Java and C#, and how we can
          manipulate it in program. You will play with types and code
          generation, which will be useful in many large scale projects.

            The products are '��snapshots'�� of information resources and corresponding metadata,
            that we can compare to later. It should also warn if an &lt;example_url&gt; becomes
            non-accessible.</li>

        <p>Mentor: Andrew Webb</p>

        <p>This project develops a client side library for the BigSemantics service in C#. The
          library will provide an easy way to asynchronously extracts a web of metadata and caches
          them on the local machine for best performance, persistently. The library allows for even
          simpler invocation of the service, without the need for process HTTP requests and
          responses. Code structure and modularization of BigSemantics need to be considered.</p>

			<h5>Project M3 - Semantic Service</h5>
			
            <span>contact: <a class="destination" href="../people/quyin.html" target="_blank">Yin Qu</a></span>
						<p>The semantic service will transform the wild web into well
						structured rich semantics, in the form of XML or JSON, with a
						RESTful interface, using <a target="_blank" class="destination"
							href="../research/simplGuide/metaMetadata/index.html">meta-metadata</a>.
						Rich semantics will be directly mapped to classes and instances in
						programming languages including Java and C# for convenient use. The
						semantic service is critical for building thin clients (web-based,
						Android or desktop) working with rich semantics from multiple
						sources, such as a web site mixing all your social network
						activities; an application allowing you to collect rich bookmarks
						(see the figure; check out <a target="_blank" class="destination"
							href="../infocomposer/">InfoComposer</a>); a mobile app that you
						can share rich bookmarks with annotations to your family or
						friends, or even social networks.</p>

			<p>The semantic service will store complex <i>metadata semantics</i> in a
			distributed database back-end, and communicate with clients through HTTP.
			SIMPL <a class="destination"
				href="../research/simplGuide/oodss/index.html"
				target="blank">OODSS</a> over HTTP, an easy-to-use web service
			framework, will simplify the implementation, by using <a
				class="destination"
				href="../research/simplGuide/serialization/index.html"
				target="blank">S.IM.PL Serialization</a> on information and message
			data structures.  However, rich semantics also brings unusual challenges:
			storing complex metadata semantics into a database back-end (we are
			primarily focusing on PostgreSQL for now) results in large number of
			tables and performance issues; the messy nature of semantics in the real
			world requires dealing with cross references both in memory and in
			database; we must survive schema evolution along with changes in the
			wrapper repository, and maintain high performance through distributed,
			fault-tolerant data stores and caches.</p>

			<p>In GSoC 2011, an Object-Relational Mapping module has been
			implemented, connecting metadata semantics with databases. This year,
			building on previous work, the student will put components together and
			finally kick off the service! The student will work with the mentor to
			design the service interface, create testings, deploy the service, code
			simple maintenance tools, and deal with aforementioned challenges. The
			student will learn about and experience web semantics, RESTful web
			services, distributed storage and processing, among other exciting
			techniques that are related to complex big data, and participate in
			cutting edge research. We will provide access to a virtualized
			environment on a many-core server that we have.</p>

			<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
			<p>Java, XML/JSON, SQL (ideally PostgreSQL), HTTP. Experiences with web
				sites, services, Ehcache/memcached, and distributed systems will be a plus.</p>

			<h4>Deliverables</h4>
			<p>The specific scope of work may be adjusted according to the student's
			experiences. A minimum set of deliverables includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Service API design.</li>
				<li>Semantics extraction as a service.</li>
				<li>Middle layer between semantics extraction service and current ORM layer.</li>
				<li>Basic scripts for testing and deployment.</li>

		<h5>T1: TUIO Windows Touch Driver</h5>
        <span>contact: <a class="destination" href="../people/bill.html" target="_blank">Bill Hamilton</a></span>
		<p>Design and implement a Windows 7 and 8 application which
			converts incoming TUIO (http://www.tuio.org/) events into Windows
			touch events.</p>

		<p>Currently the only available TUIO to Windows touch bridge
			application is Multi-Touch Vista
			(http://multitouchvista.codeplex.com/). This application is difficult
			to use, does not support multiple monitor setups, and contains bugs
			and memory leaks. The goal of this project is to create an
			application similar to the (only partially open source) Multi-Touch
			Vista, but better designed, more robust, and feature complete.</p>

		<p>Required features of the application: able to listen for TUIO
			events and convert them to driver level Windows touch events, stable,
			and easy to install and run. The application should be free of memory
			leaks and should not output ghost touch events.</p>
		<p>Other desired features include: having the application in the
			Windows system-tray so configuration options can be viewed and
			modified, supporting multiple monitors and multiple incoming TUIO
			ports, and options to disable and emulate stylus events. Future work,
			as these platforms enable support for multiple monitors and touch
			events, will build compatible functionality for Android and Apple.</p>
		<p>The student should begin by learning about Multi-Touch Vista,
			Windows 7/8 touch events, and TUIO messages. Then, formulate a design
			and implementation plan. The final application should include
			adequate documentation, so that it can be easily utilized and
			distributed.</p>
		<p>The desired student should have experience creating Windows
			drivers. The student should also be familiar with TUIO and OSC.
			Ideally, the student will have a touch-enabled Windows device. The
			Java TUIO-based simulator will in any case be utilized.</p>

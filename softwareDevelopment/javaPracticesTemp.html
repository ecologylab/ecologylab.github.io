The structure of code has an enormous impact on efficiency, as well as
readability and maintainability. This document is a pool of important
Java programming practices. The form is a list of structures that are
better, with explanations about why.

<ol>
  <li style="line-height: 170%;">Use <i>temporaries</i>, also known as 
      <i>local variables</i> whenever a computed or dereferenced value is used
      more than once. 

      Primary Benefit:
      The computations of method calls, and pointer dereferencing have
      an associated computational overhead. Temporary variables
      usually go into CPU registers, where they can be accessed
      extremely rapidly.

      Side benefit:
      You get to author a name for the temporary variable, which can
      help make the function/meaning of it clear to the next programmer.
</li>
 <li style="line-height: 170%;">Use known Java compiler optimizations.
	The java compiler is capable of optimizing some code at compile time. 
      As there are no compiler directives to enforce optimzation, it is important 
      to know what types of optimizations the compiler will attempt and how to
	write your code so that these optimizations will take place. 

	The following is a list of some best practices that we are currently aware of.
	<ol>
	  <li>
        Use final judicicously, anytime a variable or function can be made final, this
        will result in inlining of the code the final keyword applies to. Conditionals based 
	  on final variables, tend to not even be compiled into Byte Code. 
	  </li>
	  <li>
 	  Statics tend to be heavly optimized bye the compiler. They preform very well.
	  However you need to be aware of extactly what it means to make something static. 
        Only use static if it is appropriate at :an API level. 	  
 	  </li>
 	</ol>

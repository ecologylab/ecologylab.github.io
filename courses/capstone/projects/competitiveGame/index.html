			<i>
				Games are a set of rules that constrain action, to make action meaningful and playful. Games in esports, or the professional play of competitive games, are known for the their fast paced interaction, cognitive stress, and extreme multi-tasking.
				Interaction design in these games takes into account a number of concerns not normally considered in other contexts. How do we design a game to be difficult, fun, entertaining to watch, and a practicable skill?
				How do we design with new modalities in light of these considerations.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			In this project, the team will examine existing games and game
			design literature. They will construct a prototype game and test
			this prototype with users. They will construct a complex and
			creative digital game with new modalities; they will evaluate and
			playtest the game with users; if possible, an experiment should be
			used. Participants will gain knowledge of a set of existing games
			and background in their chosen project; they will create game
			mechanics, interfaces, and understand games as systems; they will
			produce a game and playtest it, with the goal of producing
			publishable results.
		</p>
		
		<h4>expected benefits</h4>
		<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
			<li>learn to develop with unique input modalities; understand the unique design constraints of these modalities</li>
			<li>learn about game design, including existing designs, creating game mechanics that enable play</li>
			<li>learning and discovering interaction design principles for high performance game interaction</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>design constraints</h4>
		<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
			<li>must be a game: "a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome" [Salen and Zimmerman, Rules of Play, p80]</li>
			<li>a real time strategy game is highly encouraged, but is not required</li>
			<li>the developed game must have well designed, integrated, and novel interactions</li>
			<li>must make use of at least one non-standard input modality (i.e. multi-touch, pen, kinect, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>bonus objectives</h4>
		<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
			<li>mixing multiple input modalities</li>
    		<li>game is serious (teaches the user, changes behavior, persuades them, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>provided development platform</h4>
		<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
		    <li>Zero-touch Sensor</li>
		    <li>Wacom Tablet</li>
		    <li>Windows 7 Machine</li>
		    <li>Spring RTS Engine with Multi-touch Support (Optional)</li>
		    <li>Xbox Kinect</li>

		<h5>special deliverables</h5>
		
		<p>
		Throughout your project you are encouraged to <b>play a variety of games</b>. This activity will expose you to a variety of <b>game mechanics and experiences</b>, it will give you new ideas about games and play.
		
		</p>
		
		<h6>Game Analysis</h6>
		
		<p>The <b>objective of this deliverable</b> is to engage you in thinking about the foundations of game design, and develop a deep understanding of a single game design element.</p>
			
		<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
			<li>Select and play two games of a similiar quality to the proposed game. In the best case your team will be able to play the games together and discuss your experiences during and after play. Play in pairs, for each team member
			actively playing another should be watching and/or commentating.
			</li> 
			<li>Consider the game design literature, <b>select two core game mechanics</b> (mechanics that are often repeatedly invoked) for each game and </li>
			</li>
			<li><b>Develop a report</b> (in narrative, not outline, form) that addresses the following question for both games:
			<br/>
<!-- 			Note that physical games and digital games are very different, and some of the criteria below apply much more to one than the other. Consider this when writing! Visual aids (diagrams, flow charts, screenshots, photographs, etc.) will be essential. The breakdown should address the following in a narrative (not outline) format:-->
			<ol>
				<li>Briefly, what are the rules of the game? What meaningful choices do players make?</li>
				<li>How were the selected game design elements (above) implemented in the game you played?</li>
				<li>What made these mechanics and their implementation fun? difficult? rewarding? entertaining to watch? </li>
				<li>Find another game (it can be the other analyzed game) that contains a similar mechanic?</li> 
				<li>How was this mechanic different? What do you think the motivation behind these differences was for the designers of both games?</li>
				<li>How were the experiences of the players and the watchers different? 
				<li>Was the experience rewarding/fun for both the player and the watcher? Why or why not for both?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			The majority of the report should address the application of the game design elements of the game you played. 
			Your report should be <b>6&ndash;8 pages long (10pt, 1.5-spaced)</b>. Be thorough with your analysis, but concise.  
			Photographs, diagrams, and other visual aids are expected, they will help you present your ideas coherently.
			</p>
			<p>
			Alternative versions of the analysis will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
			If you are interested in undertaking an alternative, specify what you want to do <b>early</b> and <b>obtain your mentor's permission</b>!
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>Lightweight Prototype (addendum)</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Your lightweight prototype must include <b>game mechanics</b> and simulate their associated interactions; it is insufficient to present only interface design.</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>Project Plan (addendum)</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>In your project plan, <b>reflect on your game analysis and discuss it</b>. Your project plan should address the following questions:
			<ol>
				<li>How did what you learned from the game analysis inform your game design?</li>
				<li>What game design elements (from the literature) are you employing? Justify your decisions.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>Research Notebook (addendum)</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>In your research notebook, you are encouraged to report on interesting gameplay experiences. How are these informing your design? What have you discovered about game mechanics and systems of rules? 
		</ul>

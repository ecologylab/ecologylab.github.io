<p class="usual">
Form your group, set your direction, and begin your journey.
In this phase, you will propose what you want to work on, why you want to work
on it, and how you will engage in development and evaluation.
</p>

<p class="usual">This part of the class is competitive. The project teams that write the best <a class="destination" href="../projects/index.html">project</a> proposals will get to choose their project.
This corresponds with how the world works in contemporary practice.
To get an edge in your written presentation, you may want to make an appointment (now!) at 
<a class="destination" target="_blank" href="http://writingcenter.tamu.edu/make-an-appointment/">The Writing Center</a>.
</p>

<p class="usual">
Develop an extended executive summary. The goals of this piece is to develop ideas about what you will do, and how.
The proposal is an argument that advocates for your team and your approach. 
It must be very tight and clear, like an elevator pitch.
Rigorously apply the template below, on a paragraph by paragraph and sentence by sentence basis. Where you think its really important, where one sentence is specified, you can expand a bit longer.
<ul>
  <li>P1: Introdution</li>
  <ul>
  	<li>S1: Announce research topic. Motivate excitement. <br/>Grab the reader's attention.</li>
	<li>S2: Explain importance of topic. Make the reader care.</li>
	<li>S3: Identify most significant prior work and conditions.</li>
	<li>S4: Identify the gap in the field. What is missing in the prior work that your research will address!?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>P2: Conceptual Basis</li>
  <ul>
	<li>S1: Research contribution of proposal, the primary objective.</li>
	<li>S2: Principal hypothesis: the most important statement of what your resesearch will establish that is new.</li>
	<li>S3: Rationale: how/why is this achievable?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>P3: Team</li>
  <ul>
	<li>Explain who the team members are, and why you are suited for carrying out the proposed research.
	What are the significant attributes of your backgrounds? Be concise.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>P4 - 3+n: Research Components</li>
  <ul>
	<li>(n = 3 or 4) short paragraphs, each about a crucial component of the research. Each consists of these sentences:</li>
	<li>S1: Conceptual Statement of the Objective</li>
	<li>S2: How it will be accomplished.</li>
	<li>S3: Hypothesis to be proved and/or result to be delivered.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>P4+n: Research Benefits</li>
  <ul>
	<li>S1: Basis for innovation</li>
	<li>P5b: Intellectual Merit: <br/>How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields?
		What are the creative and original methods and techniques that the proposed work expects to develop?</li>
	<li>P5c: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">Broader Impact</a><br/>
	What are the benefits to society?
	How does the activity promote teaching, training, and learning? 
	How does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? 
	To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? 
	</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Supplemental Materials</li>
  <ul>
	<li>For each team member, include a short resume and a one-page writeup that says what your area of specialization is, within Computer Science, and what elective courses you've taken.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>References</li>
  <ul>
	<li>Using CONSISTENT FORMATTING, present the set of references you have drawn upon to develop your proposal.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>Process: Idea Generation Methods</h5>

<p class="usual">
	Creativity research has shown that group brainstorming works best when individuals begin by developing ideas individually,
	and then brainstorm together. This helps to avoid fixation on the first idea that someone brings up in the group.
</p>

<p class="usual">
	Use the beta release of
	<a class="destination" target="_blank" href="../../../infoComposer/" >InfoComposer</a>
	to develop a preliminary collection of prior work relevant to your project, including 
	<i>needs</i>, <i>ingredients</i>, and <i>precedents</i>, in the form of an information composition.
	An information composition is a holistic, integrative representation designed to help you represent connections among diverse ideas.
	Engagement in and with information composition can serve as a springboard for the emergence of new ideas.
</p>

<p class="usual">
	Drag and drop or cut and paste image and text clippings from source documents. As necessary, drag URLs onto these clippings to ensure that they function as bookmarks, with rich metadata.
	Group related concepts. Annotate to explain connections. Develop new ideas relevant to your proposed project and its field.
</p>


<p class="usual">
<h5>Grading Rubric</h5>
Your proposals will be graded according to the following rubric. Each section apportions points, on which you should give partial to full credit, points add to 100:

<ul>
	<li>Introduction (10)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>4 - presents an exciting problem to solve</li>
		<li>3 - identifies relevant prior work</li>
		<li>3 - explains why topic is important</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Conceptual Basis (16)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>10 - describes an interesting and important contribution that will bridge the gap specified in the introduction</li>
		<li>6 - specifies a hypothesis that will test whether or not the contribution was effective</li>
	</ul>	
	<li>Team (10)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>3 - explains the strengths of the team members</li>
		<li>3 - applies said strengths to the problem at hand</li>
		<li>4 - explains how the team will achieve its goals</li>
	</ul>	
	<li>Research Components (20) </li>
	(projects may have multiple research components, points may be divided up between them for each of the following)
	<ul>
		<li>10 - objectives are clear and directed at the problems presented earlier</li>
		<li>5 - how the objective will be achieved</li>
		<li>5 - statement of a hypothesis connected to the component</li>
	</ul>	
	<li>Research Benefits (18)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>8 - the work is innovative, building on problems presented in the introduction and the conceptual basis</li>
		<li>5 - intellectual merit is present and clearly presented</li>
		<li>5 - broader impact is present and clearly presented</li>
	</ul>	
	<li>Supplemental Materials (6)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>6 - all supplemental materials coherently presented</li>

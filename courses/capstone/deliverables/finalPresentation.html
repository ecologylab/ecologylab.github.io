<p class="usual">
The goal of the final presentation is to communicate the significance of your project.
Begin with a problem statement that articulates what you have worked on, and why.
Address research contributions in terms of design, intellectual merit, implications, and broad impact. Demos are optional.
Embed a final cut of your video within a PowerPoint presentation. Use this to support your talk. 
Never read your slides! Use them as a jumping off point for explanations. Nothing is more boring than watching someone read PowerPoint.
</p>

<p class="usual">
Illustrate your PowerPoint clearly. 
Use labeled diagrams and flow charts to illustrate the major components and flow of control in your system's architecture. 
Use photos, specification sheets and other compelling visuals to emphasize critical aspects of your project.
Mine your research notebooks for material. Return to your proposal. Revise the framing you set out with to match your experience. Restate the orientation that shines through intact.
Derive new goals and results that have emerged through your design process.
</p>

<p class="usual">
	Consider the make-up of your team.
	How have the different backgrounds of your team members contributed to the work?
	Make roles clear. Make sure everyone participates! 
</p>

<p class="usual">
<b>Problem Statement:</b>
What conceptual space did you set out to work in? What problem(s) did you set out to solve? Why? How?
What is the significance? 
</p>

<p class="usual">
<b>Design:</b>
What has motivated your design? How has your iterative design process proceeded? What design did you arrive at? Include aspects of hardware, software, interaction, and experience.
Describe the created system, it's components, the flow of control between components, and the flows that involve users.
How has your design evolved from initial conception, through prototypes and user studies?
What options have you considered? How have you selected from among design choices? What has been the role of data collected in user studies?
How has your concept guided the process? How has your concept evolved through the process?


</p>
<p class="usual">
<b>Intellectual merit:</b>
How have you solved the problem? What can be learned from the solution(s)? What new understanding has your project developed? What new understanding does it have the potential to develop? 
What field(s) does it impact?
What new knowledge have you created? 
How does the project suggest and explore creative and original concepts?
How does the project advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? 
How have you combined disciplinary perspectives and methodologies in an innovative way?

</p>

<p class="usual">
<b>Implications for Design:</b>
This classic payoff for research is a distillation of the intellectual merit. Generalize what you have learned into principles that can inform others.
These principles can emerge from formative and summative aspects of the design process and data.
The implications for design are ultimate results of your work, the ones that can help other researchers and developers.
Distill significant methods and techniques.
</p>

<p class="usual">
<b>Broad Impact:</b>
How does the work benefit society? What is the potential? 
Does it contribute to education? To sustainability?
How do the project and its potential use advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? 
How does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)?
How will results be disseminated?
</p>

<p class="usual">
<b>Venue:</b>
The final presentation will be held on Wednesday 12/7, from 1-3 p.m., in Room 302 of the HR Bright.
The TA will be available in HRBB 219 from 10:00 to 12:30 the morning of the presentations. There will be a specific computer designated for presentations.
Make SURE to work with the TA to load your media onto this computer before 1! We will not have time for you to do this once the session begins.
</p>

<p class="usual">
Each group will have <b>14 minutes to present</b>, followed by up to <b>10 minutes of questions and discussion</b>. 
<i>Time limits will be strictly enforced.</i> Use your time wisely! Groups should be ready to start their presentation as soon as the previous group has finished.
</p>

<p class="usual">
 Make sure to rehearse with your final slides. 
 Ensure that each slide was given appropriate presentation time, and that all the group members participated in the presentation fairly.

<h2 class="subsection">Course Meetings</h2>
<div class="subsection">
Attendance is required. 
It may be recorded. 
Class participation, for which attendance is necessary but not sufficient, constitutes 10% of the course grade. 
You could be required to participate in the Fish Bowl at any time. 
Repeated absences may negatively affect your grade. 
Students must notify the instructor and TA ahead of time about any planned missed classes. 
Unapproved absences may result in a lower course grade.
</div>

<div class="subsection">
A final exam time is reserved for this class [Wednesday May 7, 1-3 pm].   
It will be used for final project 
presentations.  We want all students in the course to see all the presentations.
Since that is not enough time for all the presentations, we will additionally meet Wednesday May 7, 6-8 p.m.
</div>

<div class="subsection">
<h2 class="subsection">Communication</h2>
A 
<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="http://piazza.com/tamu/spring2016/csce655/home">Piazza Course Page</a>
will be used as an essential medium of communication for updates about the curriculum, including assignments, as well as for students to share questions, solutions, and ideas.
You are required to be registered to participate in this Piazza online community, to receive emails about activity therein.
You are required to check your email daily for notification of community communication, and to promptly follow-up all notifications through the Piazza website and this course website.

<div class="subsection">
<h2 class="subsection">Readings</h2>
The field of human-centered computing is non-linear, characterized by how it connects and synthesizes contributions from diverse fields, including computer science, cognitive and social psychology, sociology, design, and art.
This is necessary for understanding users and building computing systems for them.
</div>

<div class="subsection">
While a few are from an HCI textbook, most of 
<a href="materials/index.html" class="destination">the readings</a>
 are primary source materials, including HCI research articles and field-specific texts.
In assembling this material, for yourself, it is crucial to understand: who is speaking? Who is being spoken to?
Make sure to find out the background of each author.
Form an intellectual map of the players in the field.
Bonus: if you perform HCI research, you will meet some of them. 
It will be quite useful and important to remember then who they are, and what they said that was interesting.
</div>


<div class="subsection">
<h2 class="subsection">Fish Bowl Class Discussions</h2>
<p>
To facilitate a constructive dialog within such a large class,
the discussions will be conducted using the
<a class="destination" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)" target="_blank" >fish bowl</a> technique.
At the beginning of each class discussion, 3-6 panelists will be chosen at random.
In addition to the selected, mandatory panelists, there will be 1 or 2 open seats in the fish bowl for non-panelists to occupy as discussion emerges.
The panelists will be responsible for engaging in discussion as representatives of the class at large.
When not on the panel you will be able to participate in two ways.
First, you may pose questions, to the panel or the moderator.
Second, you can sit in one of the open panelist seats for a moment if there is something you have to contribute.
When sitting in an open seat be respectful to others who may want to contribute by not staying long.
It is important that you come to each class prepared to act as a panelist.
Your performance as a panelist will be a major factor in your class participation grade. 
If  you are not in class when you are called to be in the fish bowl, you will get a zero for that portion of your participation grade.

<div class="subsection">
<h2 class="subsection">Source Code & Programming Style</h2>
<p>
Some work will involve substantial coding; in these cases, both the
interactive product, and the source code count. These programs need to
work. User experience 
is important. So is the structure of your code. (Good structure will
turn out to be reusable across assignments.)
We may not grade the source code for any particular assignment, but
we also may, at any time. 
Guidelines on source code style can be found
<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../../softwareDevelopment/index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Good object oriented design is a matter of creating structure which
makes code easy to understand and maintain. Writing easy-to-read,
well-structured code counts in this class. Create reusable components
for yourself, and your peers. Whitespace, naming, modularity and
documentation are keys.
</p>
</div>


<h2 class="subsection">Honor Code</h2>
<div class="subsection">
An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal or tolerate those who do.
<p>
Upon accepting admission to Texas A&amp;M University, a student immediately assumes 
a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to accept responsibility for learning, 
and to follow the philosophy and rules of the Honor System. Students will be 
required to state their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other 
academic work. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the TAMU 
community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor System.
</p><p>
For additional information please visit: <a target="_blank" 
href=" http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode">
http://www.tamu.edu/aggiehonor/</a>

</p><p>
For this class, certain aspects of the honor code need to be clarified.
</p><ol>
<li> There may be times in this course where you or your team make use of external code/software/libraries.  
Whenever this is done, you must make sure that, in addition to following any restrictions on that code itself, you clearly document what the source of the external code was, and how it was used.

</li><li> There may be cases in this course where you or your team seeks outside assistance related to one of the projects.  
You must document, in writing, any assistance received from people other than members of your team, the professor, teaching assistants, or peer teachers.

</li><li> You will be working in team environments in this course, and your work as a team will be used to determine grades.  
As such, it is your responsibility, when asked, to:

<ul>
<li> accurately describe the work that you have done on a team project. 
 Claiming credit for work that you have not done or that others did instead is a violation of the code.

</li><li> accurately describe (to the best of your knowledge) the performance of other team members.  
"Covering" for another team member (claiming they did more work than you know they did) or "spiking" them (claiming they did less work than you know they did) are examples of honor code violations.

</li><li> prevent (as best you can) or report (known) violations of the honor code by your other team members.  
You share responsibility when a project is turned in; if you are aware of a teammate having violated the code in his/her work on the project, and do not report it, you are claiming credit for that violation yourself.

</li></ul>
</li></ol>

If there are any questions or concerns about whether an action is appropriate, check with the professor or teaching assistant first.  
If in doubt, assume that it is not appropriate.

 interaction design breakdown</div>

<div class="content">

<blockquote style="margin-top: 8px;">
<tt>
<i>breakdown</i> - The interrupted moment of our habitual, standard, comfortable 'being-in-the-world.' 
Breakdowns serve an extremely important cognitive function, revealing to us the nature of our practices and equipment...
New design can be created and implemented ... in the space that emerges in the recurrent structure of breakdown.
A design constitute an interpretation of breakdown and a committed attempt to anticipate future breakdowns.

<p>
This assignment addresses design problems in an interactive environment,
such as a system, device, or service. 
You will present your results as 3 slides +
a quick 3 minute talk in class.
</p>

<h2 style="padding-top: 14px;">turning in slides</h2>
<p>
You must export and submit your slides as a <b>.PDF</b> to <a href="https://csnet.cs.tamu.edu" class="destination" target="_blank">CSNET</a> by 1/20 at 11:59pm.
You will be presenting with a 1024x768 projector.
Be sure to show your full name on the first and last slide. 
</p>


<h2 style="padding-top: 14px;">identify breakdowns</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
Identify an interactive environment in which you have experienced breakdowns. 
Explain how the design
that was implemented is disconnected to your experience of functioning in the world. 
Be extremely clear in the language you use to describe the shortcoming(s).
Articulate design problems in terms of principles from the readings, such as

<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 2px;">
  <li>making visible</li>
  <li>affordances</li>
  <li>constraints</li>
  <li>conceptual models</li>
  <li>usability</li>
  <li>mappings</li>
  <li>feedback</li>
  <li>consistency</li>
</ul>
You can also address other criteria, such as "delightful," "fun," "enjoyable,"
if you wish,
but don't let these be the prinicpal criteria of your critique on
this occassion.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The interactive environment that you identify interaction design breakdowns in can be constituted by an information appliance,  
a software application (like a game or a word processor), a web site, a service
or anything else that fits (If you have a question about what fits,
ask me.). Do not use Norman's examples (doors, office phones, stove, ...).
Also avoid super-commonplace examples, such as ceiling fans and showers.
If (and only if) your problem device is not familiar to everyone,
include a brief description of what it does in your presentation.
</p>

<p>
The shortcoming(s) that you identify need to be aspects of interaction
design. Examples include unclear state, unclear indication of what is possible
to do or what the effects of particular controls are (affordance design), 
and unclear mappings. You need to translate these to real world tasks and
activities, such as being unable to accomplish specific goals.
Problems like system crashes, or hardware malfunctions are not
interaction design shortcomings.
</p>

<p>
Use the last slide to suggest alternative designs. 
The alternatives may be other products that already exist, or ideas.
</p>

<p>
Consider the design of your slides and your presentation.
Communicate clearly. Design the slides and your oral presentation to
complement each other, rather than 
to simply repeat the same information.
Develop slides that visually support what you will be saying.
Be thoughtful about how you make and use your slides. Don't just read them!
</p>

<p>
If it is portable, you may choose to bring the device, but realize that
you probably won't have time for much of a demo.
</p>

<p>
Your presentation will be strictly limited to 3 minutes.
You must spend exactly one minute per slide. The timing of the slides will be automatically enforced.
</p>

<p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 14px;">grading rubric</h2>
You will be graded based on the following criteria:
<ul>


	<li>Is it an Interaction Design Breakdown? Engagement-factor</li>
	<li>Clear Description of What Makes it a Breakdown</li>
	<li>Use of Principles from the Readings in Articulation of Breakdown</li>
	<li>Alternative Design Ideas</li>
	<li>Visual Presentation of Slides</li>
	<li>Oral Presentation</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
This assignment is intended to help you understand the
relationships between users and program design. We will also learn how to
use HTML 5 to build graphical user interfaces (GUI's) that run in web browsers,
and how to use <a class="destination" href="https://github.com/ecologylab/BigSemantics/wiki" target="_blank">BigSemantics</a>
to obtain and present structured information. To fulfull this
assignment, you will conduct a needs and requirements evaluation,
 create a design briefing, and build a functional prototype for a Technology Shopping Assistant.
</p>

<div class="subsection">
<h2 style="padding-top: 14px;">needs and requirements</h2>
Before you start coding or even designing, conduct a <i>Needs and Requirements Analysis</i>, 
by looking at how people engage in comparative shopping for technology.
Interview users. Define tasks and 
activities that people engage in while shopping for tech. 
Find out what software they presently use to help them perform these tasks.
How are tools helping? How are they failing? Look for <i>breakdowns</i>, obstalces to their experiences when performing these task.
Discover what works, and what hinders.
<br/><br/>
We are defining this task specifically as involving integrating information from multiple sites.
What are the roles of metadata, facets, search, and annotation?
How do people find relevant information? How do they gather it?
How do they compare products?
<br/><br/>
Investigate the activities and tasks that users perform in their consumption of shopping information.
What do they do with the information?
Pay attention to sensemaking activities.
How do they map information from shopping web sites into categories or other associational relationships, which are not fundamental in the original presentation? 
<br/><br/>

Part of your assignment is to present a study of existing interfaces,
and an explanation of your chosen feature set.
Recall the vocabulary and methods suggested by Norman, Tog,
Rodgers-Sharp-Preece, and Winograd/Liddle 
as you conduct your analysis. Write clearly. Illustrate examples with images.
You are strongly encouraged to take your written analysis to
<a href="javascript:ecologylabPopup('http://uwc.tamu.edu/')">the
Writing Center</a> <i>before</i> you turn it in. Be explicit about which
data collection techniques you use: e.g., observation, interview,
questionnaire, heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough, etc.
Articulate the sources of your data. 
<br/><br/>

Interpret the concept of comparative technology shopping loosely.
However, be specific as you investigate existing practice.
Consider shopping for very specific kinds of gear.
Consider how people use programs that are obviously designed for comparative shopping.
Consider also, activities that people engage in on the fringes of their shopping experiences.
Consider activities associated with particular social networks.

<br/><br/>
Be incisive in how you define the sensemaking and ideation tasks that people perform. 
How does the experience of tech shopping impact people's lives at home and at work?
How can new experiences for tech shopping most benefit people?
<br/><br/>
Describe your data collection process (number of participants, structure, questions, observations). 
Analyze the data clearly and
concisely. Don't present every piece of your raw data.
Consider the structure of your presentation carefully. Organize it well!
<br/><br/>
Do present a clear set of needs; connect the derivation of each need to
what you learned through data collection. The process and formulations need to
be tightly related. Make sure to remember that the next steps are to
design and build a prototype. Address here the concrete issues that
will arise later in the development cycle.

<div class="subsection">
<h2 style="padding-top: 14px;">design briefing</h2>
The next deliverable is a <i>Design Briefing</i>, which is motivated
by the <i>Needs and Requirements</i>.
Conceptualize the user experience your comparative technology shopping assistant will support.
What are the sources of information that will be supported? Make sure you are letting users integrate information from at least 3 web sites.
How are you supporting annotation? How are you supporting sensemaking?
<br/><br/>
The Design Briefing is a creative synthesis, in which you develop an experience concept, a design, and
explain design choices.
Explain which features you have
chosen to implement, and why. Address important details.

Again, use the interaction design vocabulary from the readings to articulate
key ideas.
You can mimic successful prior design features that you discovered in
your <i>Needs and Requirements</i> deliverable; 
you should also develop new ideas that extend or transform prior work.
<br/><br/>
Conceptualize relationships among semantic features, such as price and rating, that are useful for 
some task or activity associated with consuming information important for shopping. 
Identify specific information sources for technology shoppers.
They must be sources from which you can automatically acquire information, using BigSemantics or some other wrapper technique.
<br/><br/>
Design visualization and interaction techniques that convey
the significant relationships among semantic features.
Include images and sketches, as well as text. The Design Briefing
describes what you will build in the next deliverable. Be sure to be aware
of the functionalities required there, as you develop this.
<br/><br/>
Develop specific design scenarios that illustrate important design
attributes and features. Show screenshots / sketches with canned data
from the scenarios, to illustrate what it will look like. In these
scenarios, include a narrative to explain what is happening, and how it works.

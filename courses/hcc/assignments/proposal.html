<div class="content">

<p class="usual">
Form your group, set your direction, and begin your journey.
In this phase, decide what you want to work on, why you want to work
on it, and how you will engage in development. Begin creating an innovative research contribution.
Develop this installment through a process through these steps:
<ul>
  <li>
<a class="destination"
 target="_blank"
 href="http://www.mindtools.com/brainstm.html">brainstorm</a> (also 
<a class="destination"
 target="_blank"
 href="http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/treatment/brainstm.htm">*</a>)
about possible interactive applications<br/>
      (alone and with your group)</li>
  <li>read background articles</li>
  <li>research potential toolkits, APIs, and devices to work with</li>
  <li>express ideas in one or more <a class="destination" target="_blank" href="http://ideamache.ecologylab.net" >information composition</a>s</li>
  <li>iterate</li>
  <li>refine brainstorm ideas and develop consensus about a concept</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p class="usual">
The project proposal describes the 
problem/need/desire your interactive
application or device will address, 
the specific tasks users will want/need to accomplish
or activities they will conduct using your system, 
and an initial description of the components you
will need to prototype (hardware, software, etc). 
It develops your project's research contribution.
</p>

<p class="usual">
Develop this proposal deliverable as an extended executive summary, augmented with a prior work section and a project plan. 
Develop ideas about what you will do, and how.
The proposal is an argument that advocates for your team and your approach. 
It must be very tight and clear, like an elevator pitch.
Rigorously apply the template below, on a paragraph by paragraph and sentence by sentence basis. As necessary, where one sentence is specified, expand.
<ul>
  <li>Title</li>
  <li>P1: Introduction</li>
  <ul>
  	<li>S1: Announce research topic. Motivate excitement. <br/>Grab the reader's attention.</li>
	<li>S2: Explain importance of topic. Make the reader care.</li>
	<li>S3: Identify most significant prior work and conditions.</li>
	<li>S4: Identify the gap in the field. What is missing in the prior work that your research will address!?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>P2: Conceptual Basis</li>
  <ul>
	<li>S1: Your long term objective for this line of research.</li>
	<li>S2: Research contribution of proposal, the primary objective.</li>
	<li>S3: Principal hypothesis: the most important statement of what your resesearch will establish that is new.</li>
	<li>S4: Rationale: how/why is this achievable?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>P3: Team</li>
  <ul>
	<li>Explain who the team members are, and why you are suited for carrying out the proposed research.
	What are the significant attributes of your backgrounds? Be concise.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Research Components</li>
  <ul>
	<li>(n = 3 or 4) Sections, each about a crucial component of the research. Each includes these parts:</li>
	<li>S1: Conceptual Statement of the Objective</li>
	<li>S2: How it will be accomplished.</li>
	<li>S3: Component hypothesis to be proved and/or result to be delivered. Make sure these add up to establish the principal hypothesis.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Section: Research Benefits</li>
  <ul>
	<li>P: Intellectual Merit: <br/>How will the proposed activity advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? 
	To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts?</li>
	<li>P: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">Broader Impact</a><br/>
	How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? 
	How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? 
	To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? 
	Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? 
	What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
	</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Section: Prior Work</li>
	Curate a  collection of prior work relevant to your project, including 
	<i>needs</i>, <i>ingredients</i>, and <i>precedents</i>, in the forms of an information composition, and a write-up.
	Articulate why needs matter, how ingredients will be used, and how your work will be similar and different from the precedents.
	
	As part of the process of curating the prior work collection, use 	<a class="destination" target="_blank" href="http://ideamache.ecologylab.net" >IdeaMACHE</a>
	to develop a rendering of it in the form of an information composition. 
	Use drag and drop and cut and paste from particular information resources that you know about.
	Use copy and paste to gather information from PDFs, then drag the link from the digital library page (e.g. ACM) onto the image.
	
  <li>Section: Project Plan</li>
  Who will do what? When? How? Include a GANT chart, as well as a functional diagram.
  <li>Supplemental Materials</li>
  <ul>
	<li>For each team member, include a short resume and a one-page writeup that says what your area of specialization is, within Computer Science, and what elective courses you've taken.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>References</li>
  <ul>
	<li>Using CONSISTENT FORMATTING, present the set of references you have drawn upon to develop your proposal.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="usual">
Desscribe the target user population. It is important to
note that you will need to conduct some user interviews and tests
during the course of the project, so make sure you will actually have
access to members of this target group (e.g., if your project is meant
for doctors to use, make sure you have some connections at the med
school, or if your product is aimed at children, make sure you have
called some local schools to get permission to interview and work with
the kids, etc.). Relate task scenarios to actual users. Make sure the tasks really people can perform will be realistic and meaningful.
</p>


<p class="usual">

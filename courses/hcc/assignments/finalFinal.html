<!--
<div class="subsection">
A scientific research paper is a tightly constructed logical argument in favor of the
intellectual merit and broad impact of your work. Go back to how you stated these in your research proposal.
Go back to your principal hypothesis and objective. Revise as necessary.
Use this paper to make the case for them! Support with evidence. Don't overclaim. The expected
length is 10 pages. It should  
be prepared in the <a class="destination" target="_blank"
 href="../hostedMaterials/CHIpubsFormat.doc">ACM CHI publications format</a>.
Use of the <a class="destination" target="_blank" href="http://uwc.tamu.edu/">Writing Center</a>
is strongly encouraged.
</div>

<div class="subsection">
The components include:
<ul>
<li><span class="deliv">ABSTRACT:</span> Boil down the argument for your research.
Focus on the contribution. Make me want to read the paper.</li> 

<li><span class="deliv">INTRODUCTION:</span> What is the problem/need you are
    addressing? (You may use a scenario here.) What is
your motivation to do this work? What approach do you take? Why and how?</li>

<li><span class="deliv">PRIOR WORK:</span>
Identify and succinctly explain the relevant prior work. 
There are three kinds of prior work: needs, resources, and precedents. 
<ul style="padding-bottom:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">
<li><i>Needs</i> are preexisting conditions that drive the process of innovation. They motivate the relevance of the innovation, answering the question, "Why is this important?" These include stories and statistics about citizen behavior, interview data, and projections about future conditions. 
<li><i>Ingredients</i> are ingredients and raw materials that will be used for constructing the new invention. These include enabling technologies, design methods, processes, and materials. 
<li style="padding-bottom:4px;"><i>Precedents</i> are points of departure. They are prior methods, systems, and services that are similar to the innovation at hand. Enumeration of precedents, with comparative analysis, serves as a basis for differentiating the new invention from what has been done before.
</li>
</ul>
Clearly state how each citation
contributes to what you are doing, and how your work
differs (builds on it!).
Include a topic paragraph for this section, which explains how the pieces fit together.
Don't repeat other sections of the paper, where you may include citations while describing methods.
(This section could go after the Introduction.)</li>

<li><span class="deliv">DESIGN PROCESS:</span>
 Describe your iterative design process, including 
<a href="story.html">ethnographic data, storyboards, lo-fidelity
    prototype</a>, and
<a href="study1.html">design feedback</a>. How did you conduct this
    process? What were the results? What is your analysis of them?
    What lessons were learned? How do you synthesize from the analysis
     to next steps? What have you learned from formative evaluation?</li>

<li><span class="deliv">METHODS:</span>
 Describe your functional prototype. Include design and systems
    architecture. Also address issues of technology, context and the
 environment. What specific characteristics are
 important? How and why? What are the key parameters of context?
 How can they be sensed and recognized? Articulate strategy. Focus on the innovation.</li>

<li><span class="deliv">EVALUATION:</span>
How did users respond to your functional prototype in <a href="study">user study 2</a>?
Who were your participants?
What data did you collect?
What methods did you use to analyze it?
For quantitative, what were independent and dependent variables?
For qualitative, what codes did you derive? How does the data fit them?
What are the results? What measures of statistical significance can you show?
What hypotheses are proved?
</li>

<li><span class="deliv">DISCUSSION:</span>
This classic payoff for research is a distillation of the intellectual merit. 
Generalize what you have learned into principles that can inform others.

<div style="margin-top: 6px;">
Develop implications for design.
These principles emerge from formative and summative aspects of the design process and data.
What techniques and methods are derived? How are they connected to the data?
Argue for them!</div>
<div style="margin-top: 6px;">
Explicate significant methods and techniques.
How have you solved the problem? What can be learned from the solution(s)? What new understanding has your project developed? How?
 How can the implications be contextualized amidst various prior research and practice?
</div>
</li>

<li><span class="deliv">CONCLUSIONS:</span>
Restate the results of your work.
What field(s) does the research impact?
How have you combined disciplinary perspectives and methodologies in an innovative way?
How does the project advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? 
What new knowledge have you created? 
What new understanding have you developed? 
How does the project suggest and explore creative and original concepts?
Recapitulate your contributions. Develop their significance.
</li>

<li><span class="deliv">FUTURE WORK:</span>
what to do in the future. May be longer here than would be allowed in
most papers. Include how you would proceed in building a full
implementation (unless you happen to have done that already).

<li><span class="deliv">REFERENCES</span>
Make sure to rigorously use the conference format for presenting them. Make sure they are alphabetized by first author. Use Latex with BibTex or Word's cross-reference features, in conjunction with 
either <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> and its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration">Word Plugin</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTex</a> with its (Windows only) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/perl/index.html">Word Plugin</a>.
</li>

</ul>

Use screen shots, diagrams, and flow charts to help show what is going
on. When you do so, make sure to refer to them directly in the text,
and explain their relevance and function, in context.
</div>

<div class="subsection">
You can draw heavily from the other deliverables in putting the final
paper together. Make sure to incorporate feedback you've gotten (from
me and others) along the way. Also make sure to carefully edit the
entire document, emphasizing consistency and clarity. 
</div>

<div class="subsection" style="padding-top: 10px;">
Also, each member of the group must independently turn in a one page
sheet that concisely states the name of the project, what your role in
the project was, and 
what the role of each other member of the team was.
</div>




<div class="subsection">
<h2 style="padding-top: 34px;">final presentation</h2>
The final project presentation is the final examination for this course.
Each group will have 15 minutes to present. There will be 10 minutes
for feedback and discussion. These times will be strictly enforced.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
Time is a major constraint. You will not be able to present all the
ideas from your paper. Carefully choose the most important ones.
Create a powerpoint deck (or similar artifact) that supports your
presentation. Use images liberally in the deck. Do not put all
of what you will say into your deck. As a medium, the deck should
complement the speech, not repeat it. 
</div>
<div class="subsection">
Include a demo in your presentation. Figure out how to integrate the
demo with the deck. Remember: a demo is a performance. Be clear about
exactly what you are emphasizing.
Make sure to rehearse your
presentation in advance, so you know exactly how long it is.
It is better to know the ideas clearly than to memorize an exact text
to speak.
</div>

<div class="subsection">
<h2 style="padding-top: 34px;">final project as a whole</h2>
	The co-evaluation rubric is <a class="destination" href="../../hostedResources/coEvaluation-Kerne.docx">here</a>.
	Fill in entries for yourself and all members of your team. Email to me or put hardcopy on my desk.

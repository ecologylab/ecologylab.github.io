<div class="content_title">prior work -> proposal refinement</div>

<div style="line-height:140%" class="content">

<div class="p">
Thoroughly research the prior work that relates to your proposal.
Prior work includes techniques and methods, as we as other solutions
to the problem  / approaches to the scenario that you are addressing.

as well as the papers already on our reading list.
When you find a relevant article, use it to find others through
<i>citation chaining</i>. Consider commerical and freelance
applications, as well as academic papers. Create a bibliography, with
the entries alphabetized and
<a target="_blank" href="../hostedMaterials/CHIpubsFormat.doc">formatted
properly</a>. 
</div>

<h2>Contribution and Benefits Statement <span class="smaller">[30 words]</span>
</h2>
<div class="p">
What is the research contribution of your project? What new ground
does it break? What new knowledge will you create? As in CHI:

<blockquote style="font-family: Courier">
These are stated in two sentences, as shown in the following examples:

<ol>
<li>Describes an adaptive technique for improving focus-targeting in distortion-based visualizations, that flattens the view based on pointer speed. The technique can significantly reduce targeting times and targeting error.
<li>Describes a sound-enhanced system based on Instant Messaging, supporting presence awareness and opportunistic interactions among mobile, distributed groups. Can help mobile people stay connected in a lightweight, enjoyable way.
</ol>

</blockquote>

<h2>Prior Work Analysis <span class="smaller">[2 pages]</span></h2>
<div class="p">
The prior work collection is an essential component of research and invention. It involves collecting published materials that are relevant to the innovation at hand. There are three kinds of prior work: needs, resources, and precedents. <i>Needs</i> are preexisting conditions that drive the process of innovation. They motivate the relevance of the innovation, answering the question, "Why is this important?" These include stories and statistics about citizen behavior, interview data, and projections about future conditions. <i>Resources</i> are ingredients and raw materials that will be used for constructing the new invention. These include enabling technologies, design methods, processes, and materials. <i>Precedents</i> are points of departure. They are prior methods, systems, and services that are similar to the innovation at hand. Enumeration of precedents, with comparative analysis, serves as a basis for differentiating the new invention from what has been done before.
</div>

<div class="p">
Write a thorough and incisive description of the relevant prior
work. When you cite prior research make sure to be clear and explicit
in describing what in particular is relevant about that work, and how
you will apply it in your project. Also, as appropriate, state how
your approach will differ. When there is a prior implementation, do
everything possible to use it yourself, or interview one or more
people who have. Use Nielsen's
<a class="destination"
 target="_blank"
 href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html">principles</a>
to perform a heuristic evaluation of the prior artifact.
</div>

<h2>Revised Proposal <span class="smaller">[2+ pages]</span></h2>
<div class="p">
Revise your prior project plan, based on what you have learned from
the prior literature. What things do you need to change? What things
can be ommitted? What can be strengthened? Do you want to shift the
focus or framing a bit? How, and why? Draw from the prior work to set
your priorities. Make sure to innovate.
</div>

<h2>Evaluation Plan <span class="smaller">[1 page]</span></h2>
<div class="p">
How will we know if your system works? What does "working" mean?
What kind of data can support your case? How?
</div>
<div class="p">
Develop a mixed-methods plan for evaluating your project.
Who are the users? What tasks will they perform? How does this correspond to the scenarios you are developing?
You MUST make this realistic!
</div>
<div class="p">
What are your hypotheses? How can they be tested? What independent and dependent variables will you define?
Make sure your evaluation plan is specific, clear, and well-defined.
</div>

<h2>Development Plan <span class="smaller">[1-2 pages]</span></h2>
<div class="p">
How will you develop the project? Consider both the prototype time
period, and the longer term. What software and hardware technologies
are involved? What functional modules do you envision? How will they
interconnect? What is the systems architecture? Of course, this is only a
first cut. But consider and describe the functional operating
environment as best as you now can. Pay special attention to the
relevant functional characteristics of key technologies such as sensors
and wireless networking components.
</div>

<h2>Scenarios <span class="smaller">[1 page]</span>
</h2>
<div class="p">
Develop scenarios for how your applciation/device will be
used. These are informal stories, which include
hypothetical characters, who may have well-defined differentiated
backgrounds. Interview potential users as necessary to help you
deveop these. 
</div>

<h2>Abstract <span class="smaller">[1-2 paragraphs]</span></h2>
A tight decription of your project. Includes
<ul>
  <li>What the project is</li>
  <li>The problem/context addressed</li>
  <li>The solution you will build</li>
  <li>The significance: why is this worth doing? Who will benefit, and
  how?</li>
</ul>
<div class="p">
This is sort of,  but not exactly a summary of your paper. It is also
an expansion of the contribution statement.
</div>

<div class="p">
Write clearly and concisely.
Use language as consistently as possible. 
You are encouraged to take the work to the Writing Center early and often.
The entire document must
be prepared using the ACM CHI publications format for full papers.
<a class="destination" target="_blank"
 href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform">LaTex and Word templates are available</a>.
</div>

<br/>
<div class="section">
<h2>oral presentation</h2>
<div class="p">
Your group will give a 5-7 minute presentation, using powerpoint
or some similar medium, on the project. Your powerpoint deck *should
not* contain the complete text of what you will say. Instead, apply
sushi principles to create emphasis and explanation which will
complement the talk. An additional 8-10 minutes will be allocated for discussion of your project.

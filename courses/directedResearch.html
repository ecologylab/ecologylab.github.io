<p>
In general, <i>Directed Research</i> is a form of self-motivated
research that we conduct in collaboration.
As the professor, part of my responsibility is to manage the process,
which includes bringing relationships between time and
accomplishment into focus.
Students registered for 485/691 have the following
responsibilities and deliverables. Each of these must be submitted in
written form, <b><i>and</i></b> through an oral presentation.
We will need to negotiate an agreement about each plan.
<ul>
  <li>First week of class: submit project plan (a time line of
      connected deliverables+dates),
      including conceptual, software & hardware development milestones,
      studies to be performed,
      references to read, and conferences to submit results to.
      While the plan is obviously not cast in stone,
      it is a blueprint, which will set a level of expectations.</li>
  <li>Mid term report: during the 6th or 7th week of the semester.
      This includes a formal research paper on
  what has been accomplished so far, which should include an unusually
  long and detailed future work section. This paper is a first draft
      of the Final Report. It also includes a revised version of the
      project plan (all components).</li>
  <li>Final report. This should include a research paper about the
      work accomplished, in a form suitable for publication.
      Except in the case of graduating students, it should also include a 
      plan for future work.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thesis students should clearly express how the work to be undertaken
will contribute to thesis deliverables.
<p>
It is the <b><i>student's responsibility</i></b> (and not the professor's!) to
schedule these sessions. Note: failure to do this is likely to result
in an unsatisfactory grade.

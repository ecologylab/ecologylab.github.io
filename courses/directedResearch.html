<p>
<i>Research</i> is an umbrella for self-motivated
inquiry, for which I, as professor / advisor, provide intellectual, managerial, and emotional support.
The goal for <i>Research</i> is that you and I collaborate to create new knowledge and get recognized.
Products, beyond those outlined below, include theses and external publications.
</p>
<p>
As the professor, part of my responsibility is to direct the process.
This includes:
<ul>
  <li>Fostering the development of research concepts.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that we contextualize our concepts vis-a-vis prior work.</li>
  <li>Helping you form a realistic and achievable plan, given time constraints.</li>
  <li>Encouraging and pushing.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
Students registered for <em>Research</em> have the following
responsibilities and deliverables. Each of these must be submitted in
written form, <b><i>and</i></b> through an oral presentation.
We will need to negotiate an agreement about each plan.
<ul>
  <li>First week of class each semester: submit project plan (a time line of
      connected deliverables+dates),
      including conceptual, software and hardware development milestones,
      studies to be performed,
      references to read, and conferences to submit results to.
      The semester plan is  a blueprint, which can be revised.</li>
  <li>Mid term report: during the 6th or 7th week of the semester.
      This includes a write-up of what has been accomplished so far, which should include an unusually
  long and detailed future work section. This paper is a first draft
      of the Final Report. It also includes a revised version of the
      project plan.</li>
  <li>Final report. This consists of a research paper on the
      work accomplished, in a form suitable for publication.
      Except in the case of graduating students, it should also include a 
      plan for future work.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thesis students should clearly express how the work to be undertaken
will contribute to thesis deliverables.
<p>
It is the <b><i>student's responsibility</i></b> (and not the professor's!) to consider and develop
 these deliverables on time. Note: failure to do this is likely to result
in an unsatisfactory grade.

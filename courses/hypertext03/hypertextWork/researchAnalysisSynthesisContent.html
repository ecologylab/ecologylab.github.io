This course develops an in-depth examination of research literature,
in order to situate potential new research practice.
All students will be required to do an in-depth reading of a set of
papers for each class. We will take turns in the role of the
specialist who prepares an oral presentation with hypermedia support
for class, and turns in a 
written report (10-15 pages) with hypermedia support sometime later (during the 1st half of the term, students will
have until midterm (10/15) to turn in written and hypermedia reports;
thereafter, reports will be due 1 week after the oral presentation). 
<br><img

For each presentation, you will create hypermedia materials using one of the
following research tools:
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/walden/">Walden's Paths</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/VKB/">VKB</a>,
or
<a target="_blank"
href="http://csdl.tamu.edu/combinformation/">combinFormation</a>.
We will alternate who uses each of these tools.

Presentations and reports will cover the following aspects:

<li><span class="section">background. </span>
Who are the researchers?
What institutions are they part of? What is the nature of the
    institutions, and their role their? How does this particular work
    fit into their long term research agendas?
</li>

<li><span class="section">summary. </span>
    What does each paper say?
    What are the important issues that are raised?
    What are the abstract models developed?
    What methodlogies are used for investigation, development, and validation?
</li>

<li><span class="section">analysis. </span>
    What is interesting about this work? Why do we still care about it
    (or do we?!)?
    How are the papers similar? How do they differ?
How does this work connect with other research you know of (and that
    we have covered in this class)? How does it connect with work
    practices? with commercial or freeware products? with important
    abstract models?

    What can be criticized about this work? What could have been done
    differently? Why?
</li>

<li><span class="section">discussion stimulus. </span>
    Class participation will bring your presentation to life.
    We are here to learn together.
    As part of your oral presentation, develop a sense of where and
    how to invite discussion about significant issues that are
    raised. Ask people questions and invite comments. Integrate
    discussion with your presentation.
</li>

<li><span class="section">synthesis. </span>
Where can this work go in the future?
If you were going to take this work further, what would you do?
Develop a plan for continuing this work or new work in response to this?

</li>

<br><img

Expect to do a 30 minute oral presentation, using hypermedia support
    materials created with one of the above research tools.
Plan for (and encourage!) discussion in the midst of your
    presentation, as well as at the end.

What you turn in should include text (on paper), and the hypermedia
materials on cd and the web.

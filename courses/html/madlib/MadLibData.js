Fifth rule: one NOUN_1 at a time, fellas. Sixth rule: no PLURAL_NOUN_3, no PLURAL_NOUN_4. Seventh rule: NOUN_1s will go on as long as they have to.

He gave me the NOUN_2. I VERB_1 this ADJECTIVE_1 piece of NOUN_4 up my NOUN_1, two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my PLURAL_NOUN_1.

You're going to be spending lots of time doing a job. It better be interesting. To you. Otherwise, its going to be a drag.

Make sure your steps are going in the right direction. For you!

<div class="content_title" style="font-size:18px;">tips</div>
Go outside the lines, beyond the job fair, beyond monster.com. Be strategic. Be creative. 
<br/>Here are some tips.
<ol>
<li>Develop really cool projects now, as part of your education. 
Make them cool to you. Build stuff you like. Develop cutting edge skills. In the right parts of the job market, these are really strategic.</li>

<li>Build a portfolio of cool projects. 
 Show off!
HTML5 is extremely powerful and portable. It is a preferred platform for maximum distribution on your portfolio.
iPhone, iPad, Android apps are also nice.
Windows and Mac applications can also work.
Make these accessible through a web site.
</li>

<li>Shoot and edit powerful video of your work. Post the video to YouTube. Push people to watch.</li>

<li>In your resume, give more detail on the things you've done that you want to do in the future. All resumes must be edited tightly. You control where the focus is.</li>

<li>To identify target companies, read the news feeds of tech blogs and the tech part of the financial section every day. You've been doing hot, cutting edge work.
Look for companies that are doing this kind of work, too. They need you!
<br/>
Here are some example news feeds:
<ul>
<li><a class="destination" target="_blank" href="http://feeds.engadget.com/weblogsinc/engadget">engadget</a></li>
<li><a class="destination" target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/2547-1_3-0-20.xml">cnet</a></li>
<li><a class="destination" target="_blank" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/appleinsider.rss">AppleInsider</a></li>
<li><a class="destination" target="_blank" href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Technology.xml">new york times technology</a></li>
<li><a class="destination" target="_blank" href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/feed/">new york times dealbook</a></li>
</ul>
Find the companies in the right businesses. Go to their web sites. Find their jobs listings.
Pursue.
</li>

<li>Most of these companies are in Silicon Valley or New York, or who knows where. Be open to moving wherever the best opportunity is for you.
Best does not mean the most money. It means the most interesting. </li>

<li>Be persistent! Believe in the value of what you like to do.</li>

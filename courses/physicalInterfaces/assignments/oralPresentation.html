<p>
Each group has 20 minutes to present, plus 10 for questions and
discussion. The times are strict, like a conference presentation.
This time is short! Use it wisely.
</p>

<p>
Start by giving an overview of your concept and goals. State your
artistic and research intentions very clearly. Briefly contextualize
this with the most relevant prior work, including what you've learned
from it, how your work is similar, and how its different.
Describe what you've
built, and why. Don't go down into the details of your max patch. Do
present architecture, control structures, and as appropriate, the
gists of important algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Yes, include a demo. Contextualize the demo carefully in the scope of
your presentation as a whole. Emphasize coherence, connect
important ideas with design decisions and how experience results.
</p>

<p>
Make sure to have the space set up well. As you know, this can mean
affordance markers on the floor, props, cameras placed properly,
cables run optimally, and so forth, in addition to algorithms and
media. If you need any special technology, like an extra projector,
make sure it will be there! Communicate in advance with the other
groups to plan who is using which equipment, and how. Use the class
listserv as needed for this, as well as face-to-face.
You will not have time to deal with these details during our meeting!
</p>

<p>
Use a powerpoint deck, or something like it to complement your talk
and demo. The powerpoint should serve to focus the presentation. Don't
read from it! Use it as a touch stone, as a jumping off point, and as
a source of continuity.
</p>

<p>
Good luck!

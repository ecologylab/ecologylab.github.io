<div class="content">


<p>
Your project proposal begins with a statement of concept that
expresses a big picture sense of what you wish to accomplish and why.
Pay special attention to the 'why' part, particularly inashmuch as you
haven't done this before as an artist.
Next, include a review of prior work that is relevant to your concept
and intention. In your preparation process, seeing the prior work may
influence your statement of concept. Close with a thorough project plan.
In all areas, *be as specific as possible*!
</p>

<p>
This deliverable (and all others in this final project cycle) must be
submitted in 
<a class="destination"
 href="javascript:siiPopup('http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html')">ACM Conference Format</a>. Note: this is 2 columns, 9-point type, not large margins. These pages are longer than you might think of a page as being.
</p>

<h2>Statement of Concept <span class="smaller">[1 page]</span></h2>
<p>
So, what are you going to make? Why do you want to make it?
What will it reflect? 
What is the installation's function and social role?
What processes (e.g., person, social, technological) are important to
your project? Why?
Develop a 1 page statement of
<a class="destination" 
 href="javascript:siiPopup('../../materials/kerneCC02ConceptContextDesign.pdf')">concept</a>.
In this section, make sure to convince the reader that project is
innovative and beneficial. Make the contribution clear. Do this
without using any language that sounds like a sales pitch!
</p>

<h2>Prior Work Analysis <span class="smaller">[1-2 pages]</span></h2>
<p>
Write a thorough and incisive description of the relevant prior
work. Prior work includes techniques and methods, as we as other 
approaches to the scenario / solutions
to the problem that you are addressing.
When you cite prior research make sure to be clear and explicit
in describing what in particular is relevant about that work, and how
you will apply it in your project. 
</p>

<p>
This is a hybrid scenario, so include relevant research from HCI,
multimedia, hypertext, cognitive psychology, graphics, etc (the sciences),

*as well as* relevant art citations.

<a class="destination"
 href="javascript:siiPopup('http://portal.acm.org/toc.cfm?id=1027527&type=proceeding&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE')">last year's Multimedia Conference</a>.
When you find a relevant article, use it to find others through
<i>citation chaining</i>. Consider commerical and freelance
applications, as well as academic papers. Create a bibliography, with
the entries alphabetized and
<a target="_blank" href="../hostedMaterials/CHIpubsFormat.doc">formatted
properly</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Evaluation Plan <span class="smaller">[1 page]</span></h2>
<p>
How will we know if your project is sucessful?
The goal of evaluation is to establish (prove!?) that you have
accomplished what you intended to. Design experiments that will
establish this. After you have built your installation, you will
conduct these experiments  
<a href="systemEval.html">later in the project cycle</a>.
</p>

<p>
We have discussed the fact that many people (especially those who call
themselves scientists) strongly associate <i>research</i> with
including evaluation processes with clear metrics. How do we know if
we've succeeded? While this is not the nature of arts paradigms, which
typically depend on intepretive evaluations by experts, to produce
<i>creative experience as research</i>, I believe evaluation is
necessary. How can it be formulated creatively to be an interesting
source of relevant data, rather than deadly dull? 
</p>

<p>
Drawing from approaches we've seen from predecessors such as Smith,
Czsiksentmihalyi, Bodker, and others, formulate an evaluation plan.
</p>

<h2>Development Plan <span class="smaller">[1 page]</span></h2>
<p>
How will you develop the project? Consider both the prototype time
period, and the longer term. What software and hardware technologies
are involved? What functional modules do you envision? How will they
interconnect? What is the systems architecture? 
</p>

<p>
Further, what roles is each person playing in the project?
What are the milestones and deliverables that each person will be
responsible for? When? Include something like a
GANT chart. Be very specific in defining each step.

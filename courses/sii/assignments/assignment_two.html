assignment two:
<br/>
journaling and web site
</div>

<div class="content">

<p>
The journaling assignment engages you in a regular process of
self-expression, using the methods we are learning about through
readings, and other assignments. It also engages you in creating
collections, the presentation of which you will restructure at the end
of the term, during the final project. 
</p>

<p>
The web site assignment is a space for you to get your feet wet with
html, css, visual design, and self-expression.
It will also serve functionally, for you
to present your work to the class, as the term progresses.
</p>

<h2>journaling</h2>
<p>
You will keep a hypermedia journal in this class. The journal is a
personal space in which you express and develop significant issues
that are coming up in your life. It can be about anything you want,
from work you are doing to, to ideas about what you want to do in the
future, to parties that you're going to, to stuff that
you're just trying to figure out about who you are. The journal is a
space within which to develop public expressions of your
identity. Make sure each entry has depth, that it really communicates
something valuable.
</p>

<p>
Also make sure to build meaning over time. 
Develop themes. Tell stories. Build ideas.
The journal is a collection of entries; they need to add up
to something substantial, something that matters. You will use this
collection as the basis of your final project.
</p>

<p>
Each week, you will make at least 2 hypertext entries. 
In addition --
and as part of this -- each week, you will integrate a minimum of 4
media elements into the 2 hypertexts.
These can be images, sound, or video.
Some should be elements that you create yourself. Others can be found
objects from the net, or other media.
Remember: <i>choosing found elements is a creative process!</i>
Form a conceptual basis for how the media elements relate to what you
want to say through the journal entry.
</p>
<p>
Create a consistent format for the journal entries.
(If you want to be ambitious, create variations on the format, over
time, as well.) Make sure the consistency <i>reads</i>.
The media elements should be
composed with text and links, as part of the hypertext entries.
</p>
<div class="source">
due: twice each week
</div>

<p>
&nbsp;
</p>


<h2>web site</h2>

<p>
Create a course web site. Use the CSS and HTML we've covered so far.
Use the visual design ideas we're covering this week and next.
The site will serve as the class's reference point for locating your
work, for the rest of the term. Develop a concept, and focus your design.
Yet don't expect to get it perfectly the first time. You will have
opportunities to iterate.
</p>

<p>
Your site should include the following content areas:
<ol>
  <li>Home Page. This is an overview of the site.
      </li>
  <li>Journal. This should contain 4 entries, by the time this project
      is due. It will keep growing, and will likely need more entries
      by the time it is graded. A challenge: how do you create
      effective navigation?
    </li>
  <li>Media. This is a collection of all the media elements you
      collect as part of the journaling assignment. This should start
      with at least 4 elements. It will be a challenge to keep this
      area navigable, as the collection scales to grow large. 
      Create good structure. How will you organize the entries?
      How will you represent each? What are the navigation issues here?
      How can you enhance the representation to make it useful?
  <li>Projects. For now, this should contain a link to your Met Home
      Page assignment. It will grow.
    </li>
  <li>EssaySketch. This will be an empty page, with space to add content, for now.
    </li>
  <li>Final Project. This will be an empty, page, with space to add
      content, for now.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Work to develop clear and consistent visual design and navigation. 
Use color and type carefully. Create layering. 
</p>

<h2 class="criteria">

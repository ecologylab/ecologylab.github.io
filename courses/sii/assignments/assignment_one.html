<div class="content_title">assignment one: css layout</div>

<div class="content">

<p>
This assignment is about learning the fundamentals of Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS), especially relative positioning, and the rich set of
attributes that can be applied to control layout. You will also use
CSS to control the appearance of text. 
</p>

<p>
Using only CSS and the CSS-positioning HTML tags listed below,
duplicate the layout of an old version of the Metropolitan Museum of Art
<a class="destination"
href="metHomeComplete.html" target="_blank">navigational
home page</a>.
This will be a shift in coding, since they use tables, and
font tags, and for this assignment, you will not. Link to their
versions of all the images, unless they disappear (see below), in
which case, put whatever copies you need into a directory.
</p>

<p>
You will
replace image text with regular HTML text, with appearance controlled
by CSS. When replacing the image text, choose a set of fonts such that
the first one is as close a match as possible; the later entries in
the set will be fonts that make sure that at least one of those that
you specify will be available on any computer.
</p>

<p>
You will need to 
capture a snapshot of this page, at the start of the assignment.
Follow the following procedure:
<ol>
  <li>Open their <a class="destination"
href="metHomeComplete.html" target="_blank">home page</a>
      in a fullscreen Chrome browser window. 
 </li>
  <li>Save 2 versions of the page. One should be HTML only; the other
      should be "Web Page, complete". The latter will save all of the
      images for you on your local hard drive, just in case they
      disappear from the Met's site (though this is unlikely).</li>
  <li>Use the print screen button to take a screen shot of the page in
      the browser window. Use Photoshop or Programs->Accessories->Paint
      to save this screenshot as a JPEG file.
  </li>
  <li>Use Photoshop to carefully crop the image of the page, from inside of
      the browser, in your screenshot. Save this as a copy, keeping
      the original. This will be your reference image.
      Add a link to the bottom of the page that allows the viewer to see your
      reference image.
  </li>
  <li>To check your progress, as you code your version of the file,
      you can swap this reference background image in as the background, using 
      the CSS background attribute of the <code>body</code> tag. </li>
  <li>When you get comfortable enough, using a little javascript,
      create a link at the very bottom of the page that toggles
      whether or not the reference background is showing. 
      This will be convenient for development.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Refer to image assets by linking to versions on the Met's servers, not
your own copies, unless this becomes impossible. If that is the case,
please report about it explicitly.
</p>

<p>
If for any reason, there are some features of the Met page that are
impossible to duplicate without tables, explain the nature of the
limtation, how you have done your best to provide similar but alternative
functionality, and what the differences are.
</p>

<p>
Do not look at the source for the current Met Home Page while working
on this assignment. </p>

Variant: Your Exhibition
</div>
When you have finished coding the main part of the assignment, create
an additional variant version of the page. On the variant, modify the
set of "Special Exhibitons," so that one of them is an imagined
exhibition for some work of yours. Make sure to exactly imitate the style of
their presented exhibits (same sized image, same amount of text and
formatting). Your exhibit should look like it belongs, except for the
content, which can be whatever your heart (or your sense of humor) desires.
Add links to the bottom of each version of the page, to enable
navigation from one to the other.
</p>

<p>
<div class="destination">
Coding Standards
</div>
Please adhere to the following HTML coding standards for this
assignment, and throughout the course:
<ol>
  <li>Make your code readable. Use whitespace. Name styles and other
      identifiers so that each name indicates function.</li>
  <li>Put all of your style declarations into a separate .css file.
      Access them in your HTML via the <code>class</code> attribute, the 
      <code>name</code> attribute, or through HTML element level declarations.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
You will need to identify some web space for your work on this and future
assignments. In your web space, make a subdirectory called assignment_one.
Put your assignment in there, as index.html.
Email to me a link that tells me where the top of your web space is.
For now, don't tell others where it is. Soon, we will share this information.
</p>

<p>
On this assignment, unlike on most assignments in this class, you are
NOT allowed to share your code, or look at other people's. Violations
of this policy will be considered A&M honor code violations: VERY SERIOUS.
</p>

<p>
Make sure that your version of the assignment works on Windows 7
and 8, for chrome 40+ and mozilla 2+. Make sure it works for a full range
of browser window sizes, and at assorted reasonable monitor resolutions.

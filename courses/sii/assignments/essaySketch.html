1. The action or process of trying or testing.
</div>

4. A taste, or first taste, of food or drink presented...
</div>
8. A composition of moderate length on any particular subject, or branch of a subject... more or less elaborate in style, though limited in range.

<p>
<code>
<h4><b>sketch</b></h4>
<div>
1. a. A rough drawing or delineation of something, giving the outlines
or prominent features without the detail...
</div>
<div>
2. a. A brief account, description, or narrative giving the main or important facts, incidents,...

<div>
b. The general plan or outline, the main features, of anything.

<p>
You will compose a visual and conceptual interface to the important
ideas we have been covering. What are the significant models?
Describe the ideas, and illustrate the models, in one interactive hypermedia
project. Develop a creative space that develops connections between them.
Integrate theory and practice thoroughly.

</p>

<p>
<h2>nodes</h2>
Clarify the role of conceptual nodes that develop models of
<a target="_blank" class="destination"  href="../modules/theReference">the reference</a> through media, as
communication. 
For 
<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../modules/visual">visual</a>
nodes, explain the operative visual models, and comment on how your
design is embodying them. 
Why are these models important? What is their role as structures of
interactive information?
Develop explanations and new connections between the nodes.

<ul class="comfy">
<li><code>[conceptual]</code>
Vanevar Bush envisioned the 
<i>trails</i> of the <i>memex</i>, 
as a means of representing our, "association of thoughts." The memex code book
would store trail names (a form of <i>metadata</i>!), and sets of
pairs of locations, joined by the reader/trailblazer's personal sense
of significance. 
</li>
    
<li><code>[conceptual]</code>
Borges garden of the forking paths is a labyrinth, in which all
potential futures exist.
</li>

<li><code>[conceptual]</code>
Duchamp's <i>Fountain</i> demonstrated the power of context in the
    interpetation of  
<i>found objects</i>, and began the postmodern era of authoring by reference,
instead of creating singular masterworks.
</li>

<li><code>[conceptual]</code>
Ted Nelson posited hypertext as nonsequential writing, the
zippered list as an essential datastructure, and fantics as an
approach to knowledge construction and presentation.
</li>

<li><code>[conceptual]</code>
Library science offers the <i>surrogate</i>, an object that stands for
another object, and lets us know how to obtain it. In a digital
collection, each information resource is represented by a hypermedia surrogate.
Thus a collection of resources is represented by a collection of surrogates.
<p>
With
<a class="destination" target="_blank"
 href="http://ideamache.ecologylab.net">IdeaMâché</a>, 
Kerne and the Interface Ecology Lab use
composition of image and text surrogates to
represent collections of information resources. This node should
    include a utilziation of IdeaMâché , publishing a
    curation of hypermedia surrogates.
</li>

<li><code>[conceptual]</code>
Baudrillard observes the decline of the physical and the emergence
    of the virtual, the <i>hyperreal</i> world of proteinic networks
    that we inhabit. He contextualizes this amidst the transition of
    economic production of <i>exchange value</i>
    from objects to meanings.
</li>

<li><code>[visual]</code>
Itten synthesizes physics, cognition, and the history of artistic
    practice to create a theory of color harmony.
</li>

<li><code>[visual]</code>
Tufte provides visual strategies for
presenting complex information and making relationships clear.
He warns of the pitfalls of 1+1=3.
</li>

<li><code>[visual]</code>
Meggs presents explicit and implicit grid structures that organize space.
</li>

</ul>
Construct a conceptual nexus, a personal conceptual interpretive
interface ecosystem which connects these frames of reference.
An  <i>
<a target="_blank" class="destination"
 href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~andruid/ecology/theory/lexicon/interfaceEcology.html">ecosystem</a></i> is an integrated collection of elements that
are strongly connected. An ecosystem is characterized by
relationships among elements, more than by the individual elements
themselves. 
Build your interface about hypermedia, using hypermedia.
Give attention to each aspect of the assignment, and to their ensemble
of interrelationships. 
Develop the flows between them. This requires both a vision of the
whole, and attention to lots of little details. Your interface
ecosystem defines an <i>experience</i> for those who interact with it.
</p>
<p>
Integrate your own personal experience. Express yourself!
Draw on materials from your journals and
popular media. Possible materials include the wars on Iraq and
terrorism, sports and the Super Bowl, movies and tv, pop music, fashion, 
and the job market (but dont be
limited by these). Be as specific as possible!!! Quote from the web.
Develop clear analysis of what you are drawing from, and how it
relates to the concepts you are developing.
</p>

<p>
<h2>interaction design</h2>
How will people interact with the materials?
How can the site be playful, and communicate ideas?
Think of games, exhibits, visualizations, and any important prior experiences.
Use techniques such as <tt>onmouseover</tt>, <tt>onmouseout</tt>, and
<tt>hover</tt> to transform styles, text, images, visual presentation.
Be creative.
</p>

<p>
<h2>visual design</h2>
Create a clear visual design for the project as a whole. Use color
theory, layering, and grid structures. Use space clearly.
Design text intentionally.
What metaphors can extend through the work, to help you convey your
underlying themes?
</p>

<p>
<h2>iterative design process</h2>
In the course of working on developing your assignment, you will get
feedback. Some will come in class; some outside. Some will come from
the teacher; some from classmates. Also, as you are working, engage
your friends with prototypes.
Iterate your concept and design in response to feedback. 
</p>

<p>
For some examples of prior work by students on a similar (but
somewhat different!) assignment, check out the
<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="../mustsee/index.html">must see!</a> exhibition.
</p>

<p>
<h2 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:0px">evaluation criteria</h2>
<ul class="comfy">
<li>clarity of concept</li>
<li>conceptual and visual layering; balancing of information elements</li>
<li>user experience: sense of delight, play, and/or whatever matches
    your concept </li>
<li>visual design: use of color, space (e.g. underlying grid structures),
    typography</li>
<li>interaction design: affordances, mappings, feedback</li>
<li>clear, sensible and interesting navigation</li>
<li>creativity and originality</li>
<li>structure of css and javascript code</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The midterm is due as a series of installments, which embody an
iterative design process.

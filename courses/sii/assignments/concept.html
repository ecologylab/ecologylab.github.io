<h2>statement of concept</h2>
So, what are you going to say? How are you going to say it?  What is
important about these materials? What is important to <i>you</i> about
them? How can you convey that through hypermedia?! Develop a 2 page
statement of concept. Present it with HTML and CSS.
Focus the ideas and their written form. Take a draft to 
<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="http://uwc.tamu.edu/">The Writing Center</a>
for feedback. You may use
some of this text in the final product.
</p>

<p>Developing a concept
requires <i>analysis</i>
    of the materials, followed by <i>synthesis</i> of your exposition.
    Each node develops several abstract/conceptual models. What are these models?
    How are they connected? How are they differentiated? What
    examples of these models can you find in popular media?
</p>
<p>
    What other conceptual models can you relate these models to?
    What conceptual framework will you create to tie the materials together?
    What metaphor will you appropriate? How does it communicate the
    relevant relationships? 
</p>
<p>
    What found materials will illustrate your analysis, and re-present
your synthesis? 
    All brands are fair game. It is ok to use
    descriptive elements like pictures of the writers, but please know that 
    these are <i>not</i> strong illustrations of conceptual models.
</p>
<p>
    Be as specific as possible!!! Quote from the web;
provide a clear analysis of what you are drawing from, and how it
relates to the concepts you're developing.
Substantiate the relationships between the examples and
your synthesis. Articulate clear mappings between the elements you
need to represent, and the conceptual model / metaphor you are invoking.

<p>
Create a table of conceptual mappings. Along one axis, place labels for
the readings/concepts (nodes) you need to represent. On the other axis is your
metaphor or framework. Each cell indicates how you will you represent
a particular node, in the context of your framework.

Strive for sense and consistency, as well as creativity and innovation.
Make sure to convey meaning. Being pretty is not sufficient.
</p>

<p>
<h2>media elements catalog</h2>
Using HTML and CSS, present a catalog of the media elements you will
use to support conveying your concept. Some will be found elements;
others you will create. Explain the role of each found element in the
overall project.

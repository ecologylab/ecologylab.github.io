      This website allows people to see user information who sent out tweets during the Rise Up October march held in New York City. The overall view shows roughly around 200 user profiles. When clicking on a profile, user information is shown and the ability to visit their actual Twitter profile is given. There is also an option to filter out the dataset on the right by hashtags and verified status. The minimum and maximum count of favorites can be seen when using the sliders. Feel free to look at previous tweets from the users in the dataset by looking at the Twitter API.

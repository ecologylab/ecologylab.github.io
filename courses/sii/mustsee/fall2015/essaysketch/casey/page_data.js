  journalText: '&emsp;The Bible is the founding document of Christianity. To a non-believer, the Bible is just a book, one they believe is not able to be trusted because it is so old, or has apparent inconsistencies, or simply is too ridiculous to be true. But to the Christian, the Bible is everything, because it is the very words of God given to us and preserved with amazing accuracy through the millenia. The Bible tells the story of God\'s love and his wrath, of His character and who He wants us to be, and it guides us to live like Jesus, because it has documented the stories and the commandments of Jesus. Everything we believe starts with the Bible and our actions are checked against the Bible, because it is our sure foundation.',

  journalText: '&emsp;This piece of music by John Cage was as important to the world of music as \'The Fountain\' was to art. And music is a big part of Christianity, most often seen as the worship songs we sing on Sunday morning. Worship of God is a strong foundation of the life of a Christian, because God commands us to worship Him, but worship isn\'t just the songs we sing, it is how we live out lives every day, acknowledging Him as the Creator and loving Him as the one who gave us life.',

  },
  journalText: '&emsp;How great is it to sit in a comfy chair and have a great conversation with a good friend? This is what our relationship with Jesus should look like. If your life as a Christian is one of condemnation, judgement, and fear, then your foundation is built on something other than Jesus, because we should should be approaching Jesus as a good friend, not as a tyrannical master.',

  title: 'Cross',
  location: {

  },
  journalText: '&emsp;The most easily identifiable symbol of Christianity. The cross is the ancient instrument of torturous execution devised to not only kill criminals, but make an example of their death. By being nailed to a cross, a criminal would be left suffering for sometimes up to a week, and would be helpless to defend themselves from those that would come to mock them as they hung. But when Jesus died on a cross, he changed how we view it, by turning a symbol of torture into a symbol of redemption.',

  title: 'Bloody Rags',
  location: {
    x: 250,
    y: 390
  },
  journalText: '&emsp;Blood is a well known symbol of Christianity, because of the way Jesus was whipped and nailed to the cross, being bloodied so as to be unrecognizable. But while blood is often used in movies and video games to heighten horror or make a scene even more disturbing, blood can be an amazing reminder of what Jesus endured as He died for us.',

  },
  journalText: '&emsp;Churches are often recognized by their large steeples and comical signs out front. But the Church is more than just a building. It is the community of believers who meet to worship, who live life together and grow closer to each other as they grow closer to Jesus. But the symbol of an iconic Church like this is a reminder that a building can be so much more than just a building.',

var foundObject6 = {
  title: 'Upside-Down Cross',
  location: {
    x: 510,
    y: 180
  },
  journalText: '&emsp;Satan worshippers, heavy metal bands, and angsty teenagers like to take a cross and turn it upside down in protest of Christianity. To them, changing the object Christians revere most in such a way is the highest form of disrespect. But the upside-down cross has been a symbol for nearly as long as the cross itself has, when the apostle Peter, one of Jesus\'s chosen twelve disciples, was executed on an inverted cross, because he did not see himself as being worthy of dying in the same way as his Savior. The way one views an upside-down cross just depends on how you see the world.',

  title: 'Protest Signs',
  location: {
    x: 180,
    y: 285
  },
  journalText: '&emsp;Some people believe that the way to save someone is by showing them that they are bad, sinful people that God hates. And while it is true that sinners go to Hell, the way these "christians" understand the Bible is different from the message that it actually teaches. When they read it, they focus on the wrathful aspects of God\'s character, instead of focusing on His love, which supercedes His wrath. It is precisely this love that drove Jesus to the Cross, because he had to punish us for our sin, but Jesus took that punishment for us so that we would not have to face it ourselves.',

  title: 'Saint Candle',
  location: {

    y: 175
  },
  journalText: '&emsp;Many people, especially Catholics and other orthodox denominations, like to worhip God by viewing symbols of saints, those whose lives are an example how they should live. So they buy candles like these and pray with the saints who they believe will take their prayers up to Jesus. But to me, I see this as dangerouly close to worshipping an idol, because God commands us to worship Him alone. And because God loves us and wants a relationship with us, because he wants to sit in a comfy chair and be our friend, we ge to pray directly to Jesus.',

  journalText: '&emsp;Design is all about creating something that makes people think, and look a little bit deeper. That\'s what I am trying to do with this EssaySketch, look deeper. I want to understand, I want to know more about why I believe what I believe. I want to look deeper, not just at what I am learning, but what I already know, and what has been taught so much as to have lost meaning. Maybe there\'s a reason why some things are taught so frequently. There must be more than first meets the eye...<br/>&emsp;Use the arrows beneath the I Spy book to go between pages. On each page, read the journal entry and try understand how it fits with the chosen page. Look for the Found Objects in that page to see practical examples of these concepts in my life. And look deeper at the whole project to see how it all fits together.<br/>&emsp;Click the Found Object once you\'ve found it to view more.

  journalText: '&emsp;This page in I Spy is full of items like buttons, cards, and marbles. All of these are objects that are integral parts of games and such, but alone are quite useless. Similarly, there are some fundamental elements of design that transcend everything.<br/>&emsp;Everything in design is positioned in a graphic space, usualy aligned to some kind of grid. Lissitzky describes these grids as being more implicit than explicit: alignment to the grid does not always need to be very strict, and more often than not, harsh lines along grid boundaries clutter the space and are ore distracting than helpful. However, the positioning of objects along a grid, even loosely, helps to create order and association among the objects, and as such, the layout should be very thoughtfully planned out.<br/>&emsp;This leads naturally to layering and separation. Edward Tufte explains how the slightest of changes to the organization of data can dramatically improve its readibility. By grouping like items together and titling the group, instead of titling each item, we further develop associations among data, helping the viewer to understand it more fully.<br/>&emsp;On the other hand, color helps individual items stand out, and should be used sparingly, but can be quite powerful when used appropriately.<br/>&emsp;These three concepts will be found in any given design, and lay a very strong foundation for the things built on that design, because they are often the first things people notice in a design, and help guide them to the data and organization of that data which is found deeper in the design.',

  journalText: '&emsp;Found objects are the individual items that give expression to design. They are often items that many would look at and see nothing out of the ordinary, but when you select it, name it, give it a story, give it meaning, it becomes something so much more.<br/>&emsp;Take \'The Fountain\' by Marcel Duchamp. A urinal, by itself, is an item of necessity, and any attempt to use it for anything else is disgusting and vulgar. But when he displayed it in an art exhibit, he showed that art and design is so much more than just what we see, it is the careful thoughts and emotions that go into it that tell a much bigger story.',

  largeImage: 'page_4_large.png',
  journalText: '&emsp;This page is set up with a strong grid, showing many different scenes, but connecting them all together by virtue of being toys and knick-knacks.<br/>&emsp;It reminds me very much of \'Time Code\', which was a very interesting film created in one shot, but showing four perspectives of the scene from four cameras siultaneously, in a gridlike fashion. It reminds me of how everything in life is all about perspective, and so often we fall into the trap of thinking that our perspective is the only one. But we miss so much by only seeing things one way! There are so many more ways to look at a situation, at a design, and we must be aware of this!<br/>&emsp;In design, we need to know tht we are looking at the world through a lens, and we need to understand how the world will view our design, not just how we see it as we create it. What may be clear to me may be completely missed by you, because you aren\'t seeing it the way I do. But to the same end, design is a great way to show the world how the world looks through your lens. There is so much power to be had in not just telling your audience about your perspective, but in showing them, by allowing them to actually look through your Looking Glass.',

                In order to express the concepts learned in class, I will be using a genre of terminal games
                 known as <span class="important">roguelikes</span> as a metaphor. The game first game to define the genre, <span class="important">
                Rogue</span>, and its successors
                have been very influential in my life. I’ve  played them for years and I use them as inspiration for my own creative works.

                In the Garden of Forking Paths, Dr. Tsun learns that for every action, all possible alternatives occur.
                Not only do roguelikes take place in a literal labyrinths, they also  focus on the same concept of choice.
                The objective of Rogue is to traverse a labyrinth full of dangers in order to reach the bottom
                floor. Time in the labyrinth stays still until the player does an action.
                Once the player makes takes a turn, so do the other units in the world. On the chance that the player dies,
                the player starts again from the beginning in a different labyrinth.

                For this essay sketch, each node is represented by a room in the style of a roguelike. In the room you can
                navigate with the arrow keys and interact with objects with enter. The objects are my links to lexia and it's up to the player
                to determine what they want to see and when. Like <span class="important">hypertext</span>, one can freely move from page to page, stepping on an arrow.

                Rogue is a game that is void of graphics outside of the set of basic <span class="important">ASCII symbols</span>. 
                For instance, instead of a sprite or 3d visualization, the player is represented by 
                a mere <span class="important">@ sign</span>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Rogue was one of the first games to represent the player on screen.
    The @ sign, and other ASCII symbols were transformed into objects representing
    everything from weapons to monsters.

                Paul Miller explained how groups of individuals, share and remix media. This is also
                seen in the roguelike development community. Most roguelikes can be traced to a common
                ancestor. Now we see events such as <a href="http://7drl.org/" target="_blank">7drl (7 day roguelike)</a> which promotes the creation
                and remixing of roguelikes in the community.

                <br />
                    Mark R. Johson discuesses the use of ASCII art in his journal "The use of ASCII Graphics in Roguelikes".
                    He explores concepts like, why is ASCII still used in games dispite there being more appealing alternatives?
                    We see that the <span class="important">encoding and decoding</span> of the symbols creates a deep experience similar to that of reading a book.

                    Rogue and its successors also have been used as a medium for expression. One example is the game Dwarf Fortress,
                    which is considered a Roguelike. In <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank">Tarn Adam's Dwarf fortress</a>, instead
                    of controlling a single character, you play as an overseer of a fortress. In online communities, players share a save file and take turns controlls a single fortress.
                    When their turn is over they write a journal or story about what happened during their turn.

                <div style="width:100%;">
                    <span class="important">Random generation</span> is one of the most important characteristics of roguelikes. 
                    The random generation is what makes every playthrough unique. Without this, the stories
                     written by players of Dwarf Fortress wouldn't be possible. The randomness allows for every
                     Labyrinth to be unique and allows for a different experience everytime. The amount of randomness 
                    depends on the roguelike. Some randomize just the laybrinth, but others randomly generative everything
                     from races, weapons or even entire languages.

            Rogue and it's successors all take place in Dungeons, or <span class="important">Labyrinths</span>. These labyrinths
            are built upon a 2D grid. Game time is frozen unless
            the user makes an action. This focus on action, and choice, draws parallels to <span class="important">

                    This method breaks up the larger labyrinth into many smaller chunks. So this allows the user to explore to ground themselves in something much larger than what is visible.<br /><br />
                        A good example is Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup's layout, depending on the user's path, the game drastically changes.

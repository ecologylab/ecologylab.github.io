					<h1>The Vase</h1>
					<img src="http://www.artisticrealism.com/paintings/roses-blue-vase-oil-painting.jpg" <style type="text/css" width="20%"></style>
					<p>This oil painting is called <i>Roses in Blue Vase</i> by Faith Te.</p>
					<p>The power of solitude does not need to be associated with humans and loneliness. This painting appears very basic at a glance. What emotions does the painter invoke by keeping one pink rose by itself on the counter top. What does it add to the art? How would you feel different about it if there were multiple flowers not in the vase? </p>
					<p>
					"Our language has wisely sensed the two sides of being alone. It has created the word loneliness to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word solitude to express the glory of being alone." - Paul Tillich
					</p>
					<p>
						In <i>The Lone Car</i>, we learned about a woman who was struggling with the idea of being alone. Her continued rejection from John causes her to have eposidic meltdowns when they are together. In the story, we have the opportunity to let Meredith continue see John for one more time or let them both cut it off right then and there. Earlier in the story, you made a decision on the personalities of the characters. These earlier choices are reflected on what you thought about their situation, and whether or not to let them continue to see each other. It is clear that Meredith is emotionally invested in John, but was she just being dramatic? Did she indeed understand the terms of the relationship before it began? If so, did that make her a victim of love, or was it her own fault for putting herself in that position?

					<h1>Ekki Muk</h1>
					<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cAxLZpelmQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>Ekki MÃºkk is a short film/music video of a man lost and on his own. On his journey he meets a snail that acts as his companion which encourages him to continue on. In the woods he meets a wounded fox that he is initially afraid of, but the snail comforts his fears. The fox dies and the snail leaves while the man is sleeping. The man wakes up with new courage to continue on his journey.</p>
					<p>In this short film, the snail is a metaphor for the good that comes from being alone. He learns much about himself and his own fears through being alone with only himself to occupy. The fox is a representation of his fear of being alone, and that the world is a cruel dark place with others. Through self reflection, the man learns to finds joy of the mystery and journey of life.</p>
					<p>
						Similarly to the garden of forking paths, the start of the labyrinth is the protagonist's sense of being alone. There is no real escape from solitude, for one only lives inside their own mind. In this short film, a cycle of happiness of self identification and loneliness of being lost occurs. This is relatable to life, as we are constantly faced with internal conscious problems caused by external means.

						In the story <i>The Dead Tree</i>. We learn about a family who had lost a family member. They cling on to the memories of their loved one in the representation of the dead tree that sits in front of their house. Just like the dead tree, memories are not always pretty and beautiful to look at, but our memories define who we are. The family recognizes that even though the dead tree in their front yard makes a sore spot in the front yard, they believe it is more important to cherish the day where the tree was lively and precious instead of disposing of it because it gives them a negative look. The respect for the tree is more important than the 'pain' (or bad look) it is causing them currently.

						"I've also seen that great men are often lonely. This is understandable, because they have built such high standards for themselves that they often feel alone. But that same loneliness is part of their ability to create." - Yousuf Karsh

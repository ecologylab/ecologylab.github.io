					<h1>The Bench</h1>

					<p>This photo is very open to interpretation. Notice how the photographer used a wide bench and positioned the man to the far left. This leads the viewer to believe this man may be feeling lonely by simply adding empty space that isn't filled on the bench. Other viewers may look past that and see a man contemplating life. The colors in the photograph aren't necessarily vivid, but do not convey sorrow either. </p>
					<p>The photographer's choice of positioning can be compared to Meggs' and Hurlburt's use of grid structure. The role of offsetting the bench can be. Both utilize the space given and apply positioning to objects in the work to convey a message. </p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						In the story <i>It Never Ends</i>, the narrator talks about the death of someone very close to them, and how they were always meant to be something greater but grew distant through the many years. Just like the photograph above, this very short story is extremely open to interpretation. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Think about this, what gender was the narrator? If you lightly read through the short piece, you would immediately assume it was a female that was jealous of Joe's wife of taking him from the narrator. How would changing the gender of the narrator affect your choice on how the story would play out. If it was indeed a male narrator, would that make it more likely that they were friends or homosexual lovers? Would it make more sense why they had been apart for so long, and how the wife stole Joe away from the narrator?

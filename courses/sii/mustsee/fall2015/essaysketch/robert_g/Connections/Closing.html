					<h1>The End of Our Journey</h1>
					<img src="http://crossfitaerial.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/655157_xl.jpg" <style type="text/css" width="40%"></style>
					<p>This is the end to the Passage of the Subconscious Duality.</p>
					<p>The purpose of this journey was not to reflect on how your choices affected the storyline. The goal was to raise awareness to WHY you chose what you did, and how previous decisions affected further decisions in the short stories.</p>
					<p>Throughout the journey, we analyzed Found Objects relating to our course concepts in the form of Short Stories, Videos, Interactive Websites, Paintings, Quotes, and Pictures.
					The connection to course material can be found between these Found Objects and the nature of navigating the website. 
					<p>Relation to other obvious conceptual course material is made in the Passage of the Subconcious Duality, but let us review some of the more abstract connections.</p>
					<p>TAs we can make the connections of decision making in the stories to Borges <i>Garden of the Forking Paths</i>. As we make a decision, our interpretation of the text because different although the objective results of the story do not vary wildly. Similarly our interpretation of the text can be connected to Duchamp's <i>Fountain</i> which demonstrates the power of Found Objects and and role of metadata. Ted Nelson's thoughts on hypertext were relevant in the story telling, as the stories did not necessarily have relation to each other, but the linear path which we took to get to the end allowed the user to stay on track and not be diverted off course from the subject matter.</p>
					<p>Landow's commentary on archaology of knowledge is persistent in the Passage. We used the knowledge of what we first learn to make decision of what actions will take place in the stories. Everyone starts with a base description of the story, but their own interpretation and personality results in difference decision making. The text is not written to swing readers in particular directions. Answer choices should represent a complete binary decision making process, and the results should reflect the personal and subconscious duality of choice.</p>


					<p>Please continue the journey by repeating the short stories and chosing different options for the story line. Think about how it changes your view of characters and how it would have affected further choices based on the new opinions and story telling.</p>

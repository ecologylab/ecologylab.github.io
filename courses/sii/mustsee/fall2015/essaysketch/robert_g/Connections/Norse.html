					<h1>Norse Attack Map</h1>
					<a href="http://map.norsecorp.com/"><img src="https://forum.safenetwork.io/uploads/db7405/original/2X/6/6d81b4cc54949419911421859429134a30067571.png"  <style type="text/css" width="50%"></style></a>
					<p>The Norse Attack map is a visual aid for users to see, in real time, the amount of internet attacks that occur. While it is obvious that the site is not able to collect all attacks that ever happened, it is a great representation on the reality of the internet. So much occurs behind the scenes of what most common users do not have the ability to comprehend. Nor do they have any desire to understand. The website is able to track what IP Addresses, the countries, and what type of attacks are being issued.</p>
					<p>The map uses color to provide basis of large amounts of information. Tufte talks about strategizing visual cues to reflect large amounts of information, and let the user infer objects by providing a logical guide for them to follow. The attack map uses a black background and a bold teal border for countries. This accentuates the size of the globe, and providing a basis for how insignificant the individual's residence on the planet is. With bold dots constantly flashing resembling attacks, we are reminded that there is much more to our lives than the environments we live in, giving a sense for how small the individual is. </p>
					<p>Color the first thing we notice of a new object. It is the driving power of first impressions and immediately creates an attitude for your following perception. Look how color can be used to completely change the view of a web page, and to convey large amounts of information</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						In the story <i>20/20 Vision</i>, we learn about a woman, Annika, who is upset after she received Lasik surgery for better eye sight. While she does not deny the surgery worked, she is upset because now she is unable to remove herself from reality. The world is now perfectly clear and no where to escape to. Your choice chooses how she explains the her emotions by giving an example of something more relatable to the reader.
					</p>
					<p>
						The relationship between the Norse Attack Map and Annika's situation is less deep than one would imagine. It's the idea that sometimes ignorance is indeed bliss. For Annika, she thought she was missing out on a lot of the world by being hanicapped with the amount of information she could receive. After her surger she was able to comprehend the full scale of information that is provided to her at once, and it was too overwhelming. She immediately had an appreciation for the simplicity of her life before Lasik, and an understanding that it is impossible for her to go back on her decision.

					<h1>Sortie En Mer</h1>
					<a href="http://www.sortieenmer.com/"><img src="http://people.tamu.edu/~robby_grathwohl/EssaySketch/images/water.jpg"  <style type="text/css" width="50%"></style></a>
					<p>Sortie En Mer is an interactive video that simulates dying due to drowning in the ocean. The user is asked to continually scroll up on the mouse wheel to keep the character afloat. As you become tired of scrolling, the character becomes tired of keeping himself above water. As you fight, flashbacks of the characters past come in and out, reflecting on the value of life, and the need to fight.</p>
					<p>The concrete purpose of the creation of the drowning simulation is give potential boat goers an idea for how quickly you can become tired while keeping yourself afloat in the ocean. It was created by artists from Guy Cotten, a outdoor clothing manufacturer promoting safe boating equipment. With the opportunity to deliver the message, the creators were able to relate the anxiety of drowning. Although the typical user can only last several minutes, the action of continually scrolling while visually receiving information simulates the anxiety itself. Decisions to tear off clothing do not seem rational or easy to make in tough times of stress.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>In <i>The Storm</i>, we were given the choice to continue to lie to our brother about how the storm was beautiful to look at, or share the hardship of viewing something you care deeply about be destroyed. The story gives the reader the sense of anxiety when being pressured to conjure up magical descriptions of such a desolate sight. When given the choice to lie about the scene, several things should have been considered.</p>
					<p>How old do you think your brother was? How old did you think you were? While you may not have consciously come up with an answer for these while reading, your perception to these qualities were created and affected your choices. Reflect on what you remember about the story, and whether or not he was of an age where he would be mature enough to handle the truth if we gave up on the lie.</p>

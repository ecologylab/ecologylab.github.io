							Many things in nature can be see as the mixture 
							of certain things for better or for worse. Light 
							(the white) is the optical combination of all 
							colors, black is the pigmented combination of all
							colors. In terms of conflict and perspective,
							each side can have relevance in terms of what 
							color the final perspective or resolution of a 
							conflict will be. In short both sides of each 
							argument always have relevance in the final product.â€‹

				Nature has it's own "color pallet", everything including 
				humans are made or sustained from a mix of earth elements, 
				energy, water, and air. In the same way, our perspectives 
				and personalities are made from a mix of light and dark events 
				that we have seen or experienced in our life.

<p>
Welcome to the Reflection page. Here you are presented with the contents of your previous exploration, free to save the information for later
viewing if you wish.

American engineer and designer Vannevar Bush wrote a forward-thinking article in 1945 about hypertext and ideas of information traversal and storage
in a pioneering article published in Atlantic Monthly. His thinking was inspired by what he perceived as an insurmountable growth in human knowledge
and the resulting difficulties of making use of the information. His pre-internet ideas of information traversal included what he called the memex. In his descriptions,
a memex was a device that would allow users to save all of their books, records, and communications and traverse them at great speed. During these traversals, the user might
enter new notes to add to the collection for later traversal. He emphasized the importance of the associations between stored information, what we now simply call "links." This 
website borrows these ideas with its explorations and reflections. After completing an exploration through a vast collection of knowledge, the user is encouraged to reflect and make further notes about
the information presented.

American designer Jon Kolko writes extensively on the structure of information and design strategies. He puts forth that much of design involves 
drawing connections between seemingly disparate ideas. His model of the design process focuses on two steps: synthesis and ideation. In his article,
"Information Architecture and Design Strategy: The Importance of Synthesis during the Process of Design," Kolko outlines what he calls the three chasms
from data to wisdom: making meaning out of data, framing the data and meaning in the context of experience, and empathizing
with a targeted audience to improve the conveying of the information at hand. As you browse the previous exploration, perhaps you will find the remarks 
of these designers to be helpful in your creative process.

<br>
<p> Welcome to the Exploration Engine. </p><br>
<p>The Exploration Engine is a websurfing tool that allows the user to explore the information stored in Wikipedia in a novel way.
The experience is akin to falling down a rabbit hole, knowledge passing by the user as he observes. You will be presented with a single sentence
of Wikipedia information at a time. As the tool presents new information, it will transition between Wikipedia pages, taking the user on a journey.</p><br>
<p>
The benefits of the tool are numerous. The tool may be a way to unlock creativity at times when the user is struggling against a creativity block; 
it's presentation of new information can force the users thoughts out of its current, narrow scope. The tool may also induce a state of daydreaming,
inspiring the user's mind to veer off into unknown territory. <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/23/10/1117">Studies</a> indicate that this type 
of experience can improve creative problem solving skills as well. With the addition of audio, the website may even provide a meditative experience. 
I encourage you to explore the website yourself and discover these properties. The audio presented on this website is provided by user "talk midway"
from Soundcloud.com and you can find more of his work <a href="https://soundcloud.com/talkmidway">here</a> if you're interested in hearing more.
</p><br>
<p>
The website's inspiration falls partially from youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA">Vsauce</a> whose charismatic
narrator, Micheal, presents brief lectures of profound, synthesized information from far-reaching sources. Check out the channel if you enjoy using the Exploration Engine.
</p><br>
<p>
The different pages found in the navigation bar at the top of the website provide differing experiences traversing Wikipedia. The free exploration tool allows 
you to choose a Wikipedia page of your liking to start at and presents the most basic of the exploration types. The guided explorations provide varied experiences
and discuss overarching design and structural concepts regarding the Internet. 
</p><br>
<p>
Upon finishing your exploration and pressing the end button, you will be presented with a page with all of the information presented during the exploration where you
may further investigate the connections and information.
</p><br>
<p>
You may alter the transition speed and sound settings in the settings menu at the top of the website if you find the experience requires adjustment. The menus are 
collapsible to remove distractions. Should your browser offer a fullscreen mode, it also improves upon the experience dramatically by further removing distractions.
Enjoy the website.

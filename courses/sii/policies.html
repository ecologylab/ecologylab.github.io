The work we do in this class functions semiotically, artistically,
socially, culturally, and aesthetically, as well as technologically,
and in terms of usability. Please create your work with this in
mind. You will be evaluated as such. We will develop these senses over
the course of the term. 
<br />  
<h4 class="destination">interactive work</h4>
You will create a home page, where you will post your interactive
work. You will add a link for each piece you want us to see. We will
develop ways to organize these links; this navigational organization
will be significant. 
<br />
<br />
Some work will involve substantial coding; in these cases, both the
interactive product, and the source code count. These programs need to
work. User experience 
is important. So is the structure of your code. (Good structure will
turn out to be reusable across assignments.)
We may not grade the source code for every assignment, but
we also may, at any time. 
We will always check out your interactive work.  

<h4 class="destination">grading</h4>
<table>
<tr><td class="grade">9%</td><td>Journaling</td></tr>
<tr><td class="grade">24%</td><td>Midterm Project</td></tr>

<tr><td class="grade">4%</td><td>Quizzes as Needed</td></tr>

</table>

<h4 class="destination">quoting vs. plagiarism</h4>
One nice thing about HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript code is that it is you can almost always see how
someone did something, just by using ViewSource, or by asking the
browser or wget to retreive a file explicitly. Similarly, hypermedia
authoring involves quoting. On most assignments, you can borrow and
quote as much as you want in this class. Assignment one is an example
of an exception. When you do borrow and quote MAKE SURE to tell us what you
are quoting, and where we can find it. (Failure to do so is
<a href="javascript:siiPopup('http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule20.htm')">plagiarism</a>.)
<br />  
<br />
You can even reference your classmates' ideas for the same assignment,
as long as you cite. In fact, that could get quite interesting. You
will be evaluated partially on *what* you choose to reference, and
also on *how*. How do you transform the function and meaning of the
referenced material?

<h4 class="destination">web authoring</h4>
You will write all code in this class by hand. The use of wysiwg
authoring tools, such as front page, dreamweaver, etc, is not
permitted. Failure to respect this will result in an automatic F for
the entire course. 

<h4 class="destination">participation</h4>
Attendance is mandatory. It is necessary, but not sufficient, for doing well at class participation.
Participation is based on thoughtful engagement.

<h4 class="destination">quizzes</h4>
Quizzes may be given by the instructor, at any time.
If no quizzes are given, allocated points will be redistributed to Journaling, Midterm, Small Projects, and Participation.

<h4 class="destination">programming style</h4>
Good object oriented design is a matter of creating structure which
makes code easy to understand and maintain. Writing easy-to-read,
well-structured code counts in this class. Create reusable components
for yourself, and your peers. Whitespace, naming, and modular
structure are keys.
<br /> 
<br />
At the same time, scripting code and markup actually needs to be
downloaded. Thus, unlike with compiled languages and local
filesystems, conciseness is also particularly valued. You need to
always be aware of download times.
<br />
<br />
NB: In HTML (and not in JavaScript, nor in just about any programming
language you've ever used before), space is a significant
character. The insertion of whitespace can make a big difference in
appearance. On the other hand, all whitespace characters are
equivalent, and multiple in succession are the same as one. Use
whitespace judiciously, to improve readability.

In this course, you will make cool stuff that communicates. 
Make it with a sense of the context that it will operate in. We work with
an ecosystems approach: we connect diverse methodologies. We integrate
theory and practice, analysis and intuition, science and art,
technolgy and aesthetics. We integrate them according to the principle
of equal value: none is more important, in advance, We adapt our focus
interpretively, based on the situation.
</p>

<p>
We do this because the information age demands it. All sorts of
representations connect in the nexus of the interface.
</p>

<p><h4 class="destination">studio art course</h4>
This is a <i>studio art</i> course. 
Computing, specifically, the web, is the medium in which you will create.
The function of the course is to engage you in developing your own expressive voice.
This is probably the only studio art course in our College of Engineering, and in most any computer science department in the U.S.
</p>

<p><h4 class="destination">splitting into studios</h4>
The heart of a <i>studio</i> is to share work and feedback. 
We need to scale that with not more than 20 people per studio, so there can be time for conversation.
Thus, we will separate into 3 distinct studios: CHEN (104), BRIGHT (302), and TEAG (323).
Continuity is important. 
You will be assigned to a studio for the duration of the semester.
</p>

<p><h4 class="destination">studio presentations</h4>
One of the most important ways we learn about interactive work, is to
give and receive feedback. We will regularly spend time in the studio
discussing people's work. 
The plan is that we will talk about everyone's work in studio.
Occasionally, we may examine and discuss the best work in class. 
Details about studio process are
<a class="destination" target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/8Cxv1F">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Be prepared to make presentations.
Look forward to it. 
Our job is  to create a constructive environment, where people feel
supported, yet critique is part of the dialogue. 
Please be gentle and direct.
</p>

<p><h4 class="destination">read actively and critically</h4>
An important operational philosophy, which underlies hypermedia and the
ecosystems approach, is that reading is active engagement, not passive
reception. 
<ul> 
<li>You must read actively. Highlight and annotate. Make notes. Interpret! Go back and forth in the work, to develop understandings and questions.
</li>
<li>
When you read, ask questions about context. Apply the measuring stick of the feminist sociological filmmaker and theorist, Trinh
T. Minh-Ha: Who is speaking? Who is being spoken to?
What is your own position?
You must contextualize your reading with critical perspective.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h4 class="destination">user studies &amp; iterative design</h4>
The best way to find out how people will receive your interactive work
is to try it out on them. Recruit a pool of friends who you can bounce
stuff off of. Don't just give them demos. Get out of the way. Let them
drive. Record your observations.

Emphasize qualitative data. Understand user experiences. 
Engage in <i>iterative design</i>: continuously update your work in response to your data.
Explain your data and decisions when you present and turn-in deliverables.

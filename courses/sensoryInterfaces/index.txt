The time when punch cards, mice, and keyboards are sufficient as input modalities for human computer interaction has passed.
Instead, now we require richer sensory modalities, enabling interactive computing systems to respond to people and the world.

The focus of this research-oriented course is to build engaging human experiences based on sensing embodied forms of expression and recognition.
We will begin by studying how to connect the Cypress Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC) to hardware sensors, to capture many forms of real world events.
These can include IR LEDs and diodes, Near Field Communication (NFC), Galvanic Skin Response (for "excitation"), and many others.
The PSoC is notable because it can be configured to provide signal chain support, such as pre-amplication and filtering, in the analog domain,
as well as digital signal processing (DSP) and other computing before sending data to a host computer using a medium such as USB.
Support for sensor buses, such as SPI (Serial Perheral Interface), is also facilitated.
The recently ubiquitous sensor kits of smart phones, which include cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and touch screens are also in play,
as is The Interface Ecology Lab's multi-finger ZeroTouch sensor.

This is a skills and project oriented course for advanced students to develop innovative research.

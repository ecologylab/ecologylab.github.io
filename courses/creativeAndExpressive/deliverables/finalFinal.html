<h2>final paper</h2>
The final paper is a report of the development of your project, which
emphasizes its research contribution. It should 
be prepared in the format for the target <a class="destination" target="_blank"
 href="venues.html">venue</a> you  have selected.
Make sure to read a bunch of other papers from that venue, so you can
understand what is expected there, as well as what has been done there.
The expected
length is 10 pages of tiny conference type with the appropriate small
margins, or an equivalent length for a journal. 
Use of the <a href="javascript:siiPopup('http://uwc.tamu.edu/')">Writing Center</a>
is strongly encouraged.
</div>

<div class="element">
Research paper components include:
<ul>
<li><span class="deliv">ABSTRACT:</span> focus on the
    contribution. Tell me what you did. Make me want to read the paper.
    This is an elevator pitch.</li> 

<li><span class="deliv">INTRODUCTION:</span> What is the problem/need you are
    addressing? (You may use a scenario here.) What is
your motivation to do this work?</li>

<li><span class="deliv">APPROACH:</span>
 What is the basis for your solution? How are you working?
    How are you developing your contribution?</li>

<li><span class="deliv">DESIGN PROCESS:</span>
 Describe your design process, including 
<a href="story.html">ethnographic data, storyboards, lo-fidelity
    prototype</a>, and
<a href="study1.html">design feedback</a>. How did you conduct this
    process? What were the results? What is your analysis of them?
    What lessons were learned? How do you synthesize from the analysis
     to next steps? What are the social proxies for contextual state
 and social interaction? How are they represented (i.e., feedback,
 affordances)? Why?</li>

<li><span class="deliv">IMPLEMENTATION:</span>
 Describe your functional prototype. Include design and systems
    architecture. Also address issues of technology, context and the
 environment. What are the specific characteristics of use context,
    interface, semantics, design, and technology that are
 important? How and why? </li>

<li><span class="deliv">EVALUATION:</span>
 What evaluation method are you using? How does this relate to your project's
    goals? What data have you collected?
    Make methods clear. Present data (use graphs and statistical tests, as appropriate).
    Develop clear analysis.
</li>

<li><span class="deliv">PRIOR WORK:</span>
Identify the relevant prior work -- needs, ingredients, and precedents.
Tilt your selection to prior work published in the target venue.
Clearly state how each citation
contributes to what you are doing, and how your work
differs (builds on it!).
Note, some of this should have come up in Approach and elsewhere above, but
you can go into more detail here.
</li>

<li><span class="deliv">DISCUSSION:</span>
 an interpretive analysis of the research contribution,
    based on all that has been done. What are the implications of the
 results? How can these implications be contextualized?</li>

<li><span class="deliv">CONCLUSIONS:</span>
a boiled down statement of research contribution, in context.
</li>

<li><span class="deliv">FUTURE WORK:</span>
what to do in the future. May be longer here than would be allowed in
most papers. Include how you would proceed in building a full
implementation (unless you happen to have done that already).

<li><span class="deliv">REFERENCES</span>
</li>

</ul>

Use screen shots, diagrams, and flow charts to help show what is going
on. When you do so, make sure to refer to them directly in the text,
and explain their relevance and function, in context.
</div>

<div class="subsection">
Draw from your prior class deliverables as appropriate in putting this final
paper together. Make sure to incorporate feedback you've gotten (from
me and others) along the way. Also make sure to carefully edit the
entire document, emphasizing consistency and clarity. 
</div>

<div class="element" style="padding-top: 10px;">
Additionally, each member of the group should independently turn in a one page
sheet that concisely states the name of the project, what your role in
the project was, and 
what the role of each other member of the team was.
</div>

<div class="source" style="margin-top: 40px;">
due thursday 5/10, unless you are graduating, in which case 5/8

<div class="subsection">
<a name="presentation">
<h2 style="padding-top: 34px;">final presentation</h2>
</a>
The final presentation session will be held in room 907. There may be
a few outside guests.
Each group will have 15 minutes to present. There will be 5 minutes
for feedback and discussion. These times will be strictly enforced.
</div>
<div class="element">
Time is a major constraint. You will not be able to present all the
ideas from your paper. Carefully choose the most important ones.
Create a powerpoint deck (or similar artifact) that supports your
presentation. Use images liberally in the deck. Do not put all
of what you will say into your deck. As a medium, the deck should
complement the speech, not repeat it. NEVER PRESENT BY READING YOUR POWERPOINT!
</div>
<div class="element">
Include a demo in your presentation. Figure out how to integrate the
demo with the deck. Remember: a demo is a performance. Be clear about
exactly what you are emphasizing.
Make sure to rehearse your
presentation in advance, so you know exactly how long it is.
It is better to know the ideas clearly than to memorize an exact text
to speak.

<div class="p">
Create a 3-5 minute video to document your project.
What's cool about how it works?
How would people use it?
Represent the interactivity that cannot be understood from a text description.
Make it snappy. Be to the point, and clear.
As William Carlos Williams said, "Show me, don't tell me."
</div>
<div class="p">
Think about framing. Develop a story. Draw our interest.
Include a narration, the screen captures you see as appropriate,
and whatever other contextualizing shots are appropriate.
</div>
<div class="p">
To get footage of the program, you can perform screen capture with
<a target="_blank"
 href="http://www.etrusoft.com/screen-recorder/"> quick screen recorder</a>.
For physical life shots, of people and the world,
you can check out a camcorder from the help desk, or use the one
in the lab, hooked up directly by firewire to one of the Macintoshes.
</div>

<div class="p">
If you include live shots, how will the camera angle move?
What perspectives are you showing? Why?
Develop a <i>mise-en-scene</i>.
</div>
<div class="p">
Think carefully about edit points. Create match cuts where appropriate.
Be abrupt sometimes, too.
Develop a <i>montage</i>, based on juxtaposition, and the flow of time.
</div>

<div class="p">
Record audio with one or both of the microphones we have in class.
As we discussed in class, you must choose the microphone, and position
your subjects in the room to optimize audio acquisition.
You want a clean signal, with a minimum of relfections, as well as a
minimum of noise.
</div>

<div class="p">
Given the equipment we have, to minimize noise, and mazimize signal
quality, you can use QuickTime Pro to
record straight into the Pro-Tools interface in the studio. This will
ensure that you maintain synch between audio and video.

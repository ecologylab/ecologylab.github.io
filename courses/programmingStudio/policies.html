<h2 class="subsection">Course Meetings</h2>
<div class="subsection">
The course is listed as a 2-hour per week lecture, and 2-hour per week lab. 
However it is intentionally scheduled for 3 hours per week of lecture 
(along with the lab).  We will meet a minimum of 18 lecture periods 
over the course of the semester.  The idea is to "front-load" these lectures in the 
earlier part of the semester, to cover material that might be useful when 
working on the programming projects, and spend less lecture time during the 
project periods themselves.  Also, some days when the instructor travels might 
be used as some of the "missed" days.  The specific list of days we will meet 
will be provided on the course web page.  
</div>
<div class="subsection">
Attendance is required. 
It may be recorded in lectures and labs. 
Class participation, for which attendance is necessary but not sufficient, will contribute significantly to the
16% individual
portion of the course grade. 
Repeated absences may negatively affect your grade. 
In addition, students might miss quizzes, which will not be made up without prior approval. 
Students with absences should notify the instructor ahead of time about any planned missed classes or labs. 
Unapproved absences may result in a lower course grade.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
A final exam time is reserved for this class.  While there will not be a  regular final exam, we will use this time for final project presentations.
In fact, we will additionally use other times the same day for final project presentations, because there are many groups.
We will schedule this to avoid conflicts with students' other exams.
</div>

<div class="subsection">
<h2 class="subsection">Work</h2>
You should expect to spend a significant amount of time (>10 hours/week) outside of class time on programming projects. 
This will require meeting with team members outside of the class/lab periods.
</div>

<div class="subsection">
<h2 class="subsection">Communication</h2>
A 
<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="http://piazza.com/tamu/spring2014/csce315/home">Piazza Course Page</a>
will be used as an essential medium of communication for updates about the curriculum, including assignments, as well as for students to share questions, solutions, and ideas.
You are required to be registered to participate in this Piazza online community, to receive emails about activity therein.
You are required to check your email daily for notification of community communication, and to promptly follow-up all notifications through the Piazza website and this course website.
</div>


<h2 class="subsection">Grading</h2>
<div class="subsection">
There will be two major team projects in the course. The first counts for 28% of the overall grade. The 2nd, more extended team project will count for 56% of the overall grade.
Specific grading criteria for each project will be announced when that project is assigned. 
The grade may include factors such as evaluation of code clarity, team work, etc. 
Peer evaluation may be used as a contributing factor to  grades. 
</div>
<div class="subsection">
The remaining 16% of the grade will be an individual grade based on individual assignments, quizzes, participation in the course survey, 
and an evaluation of class participation (including participation in code reviews). 
Individual assignments will be small programming assignments to be completed on an individual basis.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
The 16% of the grade will start off as being based totally on instructor evaluation of class participation and effort. 
As the course progresses, any quizzes, individual assignments, and other specific graded material will note the portion of this individual grade which that quiz/assignment/etc. affects. 
The remainder of the individual grade will be based on the subjective class participation and effort grade. 
For example, if there are 8 quizzes at 1% each, one individual assignment at 4%, and participating in the course evaluation is 2%, then the remaining 2% is based on the subjective evaluation.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
The grading scale expected to be used is 
<blockquote>
A &gt;  90% &gt; B &gt; 80% > C &gt; 70% &gt; D &gt; 60% > F. 
</blockquote>
In addition to this, the instructor reserves the right to provide a relative or absolute curve to the final class grade (note that such a curve has not always been applied, and should not be assumed). 
Also, the instructor may raise the grades of any students near a borderline based on a subjective evaluation of class participation and effort.
</div>

<h2 class="subsection">Evaluation</h2>
<div class="subsection">
<li>
<b>Late Assignments:</b> Each project will have a specified date and time when intermediate and final deliverables are due. 
Any deliverables that are turned in late will result in a penalty applied to the overall project grade.
This will affect the grade  on that project for all team members (Except, if individual reports are late, those will affect only the grade for that team member.). 
The total number of minutes, m, that assignments within a project are late will be added up. 
The final grade on the project will be multiplied by 0.9998m. For example, if the project is 1 hour late, you lose a bit over 1%. 
If it is one day late, you lose about 25%. After 3 days, you're down to 42% of your grade lost.
</li>
<li>
Quizzes: The instructor may give out small quizzes in class to ensure that students are continuing to follow course material. 
Any quizzes will be short and simple, related to recent course discussions or reading assignments. 
Quizzes will affect the 16% individual grade. 
Makeup quizzes will not be offered without prior approval.
</li>
<li>
Course Evaluation: An online course evaluation will be used for the class. 
Participation in this evaluation will affect the 16% individual grade (the specific amount will be announced toward the end of the course).
</li>
<li>
Code Documentation: A key part of this class is understanding the importance of clear code construction and documentation. So, when assignments are graded, a significant portion of the grade may be based on an evaluation of how well the code is written, and how easy it is to follow. 
Just producing code that "works" is not sufficient.
It is your responsibility to produce code with good structure, which the grader can follow.
</li>
</div>


<h2 class="subsection">Honor Code</h2>
<div class="subsection">
An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal or tolerate those who do.
<p>
Upon accepting admission to Texas A&amp;M University, a student immediately assumes 
a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to accept responsibility for learning, 
and to follow the philosophy and rules of the Honor System. Students will be 
required to state their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other 
academic work. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the TAMU 
community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor System.
</p><p>
For additional information please visit: <a target="_blank" 
href=" http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode">
http://www.tamu.edu/aggiehonor/</a>

</p><p>
For this class, certain aspects of the honor code need to be clarified.
</p><ol>
<li> There may be times in this course where you or your team make use of external code/software/libraries.  
Whenever this is done, you must make sure that, in addition to following any restrictions on that code itself, you clearly document what the source of the external code was, and how it was used.

</li><li> There may be cases in this course where you or your team seeks outside assistance related to one of the projects.  
You must document, in writing, any assistance received from people other than members of your team, the professor, teaching assistants, or peer teachers.

</li><li> You will be working in team environments in this course, and your work as a team will be used to determine grades.  
As such, it is your responsibility, when asked, to:

<ul>
<li> accurately describe the work that you have done on a team project. 
 Claiming credit for work that you have not done or that others did instead is a violation of the code.

</li><li> accurately describe (to the best of your knowledge) the performance of other team members.  
"Covering" for another team member (claiming they did more work than you know they did) or "spiking" them (claiming they did less work than you know they did) are examples of honor code violations.

</li><li> prevent (as best you can) or report (known) violations of the honor code by your other team members.  
You share responsibility when a project is turned in; if you are aware of a teammate having violated the code in his/her work on the project, and do not report it, you are claiming credit for that violation yourself.

</li></ul>
</li></ol>

If there are any questions or concerns about whether an action is appropriate, check with the professor or teaching assistant first.  
If in doubt, assume that it is not appropriate.

<div class="subsection">
<h2 class="subsection">Students with Disabilities</h2>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. 
Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. 
Inasmuch as you may have a disability requiring support, resources are

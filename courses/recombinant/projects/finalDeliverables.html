<p>
As the assignment reads, you are creating 2 deliverables for the ACM
Multimedia Conference Interactive Art Program:
(1) an art program conference track paper, and (2)
an art exhibition submission.
</p>

<h2>MM 2005 Art Program Conference Track Paper</h2>
<blockquote>
"We solicit papers describing interactive multimedia art works, tools,
applications, and technical approaches for creative uses of multimedia
content and technology. Emphasis will be given to novel works that use
a rich variety of media and those that are interactive, particularly
works that exploit non-conventional human-computer interfaces or
sensors in new and emerging areas. We strongly encourage papers with a
strong technical content written by artists."
</blockquote>
<p>
This is an 8-page paper in
<a class="destination" 
 href="javascript:siiPopup('http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html')">ACM Conference Format</a>.
Draw from, integrate, and refine all of the prior deliverables from
the final project sequence. Where I and/or the class have given you
feedback, make sure to iterate on the work. Make sure the concept
statement is clear!
Be very precise in the
prior work section. Be very consistent throughout the document in your
use of language. Be careful about the assumptions you make about what
people know: define important terms, using citations. Connect the
design with the concept. Include only the most interesting technical
specs. Let us know about the important design decisions. How did they
arise? Why did you make the choices you did? 
Provide details on how participants have responded. 
</p>

<h2>MM 2005 Art Exhibition</h2>
Orient this statement toward the 
<a class="destination" 
 href="javascript:siiPopup('http://acmmm05.comp.nus.edu.sg/artprogram_statement.htm')">art program
exhibition statement</a>, because this is a statement from the
curators about what they are looking for. This submission
 includes:
<ul style="margin-left: 0px;">
<li>"a 2 page statement that includes artistic motivation, project
    description, and technical details." -- Its a small space, so make
    sure that motivation and description are very clear. This should
    be in confernece format.
<li>"a video that demonstrates the experience of the installation."
Best to post this on a web server with enough bandwidth,
    and submit the URL, otherwise, you 
    have to deal with making a dvd-rom, and sending this to them physically.
    <span class="smaller">Most groups already have at least 1 member with
    access to web space on the ecologylab or CSDL servers.</span>
<li>"a project information sheet stating installation requirements and
    stage of completion of the work." I think this doesn't need to be
    in conference format.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Use photos and diagrams smartly in both of the written pieces.
They should show important aspects of the experience, bu they shouldnt
be padding.
</p>

<p>

Please post all of it on the web, and email the URL.</i>

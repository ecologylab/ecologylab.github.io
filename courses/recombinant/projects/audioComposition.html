<div class="content_title">audio surrogates composition</div>

<div class="content">

<p class="main">
Surrogates are smaller units of meaning that represent larger
information/media elements.

Choose and/or create some audio clips that are significant with regard to some
meaning that you want to communicate.
Use audio sampling and metadata to create 1 or more surrogates for
each of the audio samples.
Create a composition that assembles the surrogates in a manner that 
is semiotically and sonically effective.
Use techniques such as repetition / looping, audio processing
(e.g., filtering, sample playback rate manipulation (time dilation), ...),
and in/determinacy.
</p>

<p class="main">
Think of each surrogate as mapping to one or more "instruments".
Each instrument's part should evolve in clear way over time.
That is, create temporal structure for each instrument.
You can do this procedurally, with control structures.
At the same time, consider the relationships of the instruments.
Thus an instrument and its part include sonic material and control
structure(s).
</p>

<p class="main">
Conceptualize and document a score for your composition.
A typical structure for a score is a grid.
Delimit the y axis into regions that correspond to each instrument.
The x axis corresponds to units of time.
In the grid, you notate what the instrument will be doing.
As the composition puts the instruments together, the score puts
together representations of what the instruments are doing.
</p>

<p class="main">
Create a Max patch to deliver your composition.
The patch should have some parameters than can be adjusted/tweaked at
performance time.
Be intentional in the experience that you develop for the
audience/participants through the composition, including the use of
variability. Also consider the form, structure, content, and delivery
of the metadata. 
</p>


<p class="main">
How are you using the steps of selection, placement, treatments, and
fastening to affect recombinant information?!
</p>

<h2 class="criteria">
criteria of evaluation
</h2>

<ul class="comfy">
<li>Conceptual basis for the choice of source materials, the samples
    extracted, the surrogates constructed, and the composition assembled.</li>
<li>Sample editing and processing techniques.</li>
<li>Use of Max to create dynamic procedurality.</li>
<li>The control structures you create.</li>
<li>Meanings communicated through experience.</li>
<li>Relationships between metadata, media, composition, and experience.
<li>The mappings between sounds, ideas, and control structures.</li>
<li>Use of the stereo space to create separation between sounds that
    happen at the same time. (Another technique for creating
    separation is to also use filtering (separation in frequency space).)

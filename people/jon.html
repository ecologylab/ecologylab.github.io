<p class="people_text" clear="left">
I am an interdisciplinary design engineer interested in developing rich 
multimodal interfaces to enable creative expression through computation.
Aside from my academic background as a computer engineer, I am interested
in electronic music composition and performance. My interest in high-bandwidth
sensory systems partially springs from the applications these systems have in 
electronic music performance, and the intimate ties they create between performer, 
performance, and audience.
</p>

<p class="people_text" clear="left">
My current work is focused on multi-touch input. <a href="../research/publications/moeller-zerotouch.pdf">ZeroTouch</a>, the current iteration of this research, 
allows for zero-force, zero-thickness, completely transparent multi-touch sensing. It's unique form-factor
allows for trivial display integration as compared to other optical multi-touch solutions.
</p>
<p class="people_text" clear="left">
 Prior to ZeroTouch, I had developed a novel form of optoelectronic, pressure sensitive multi-touch sensing known as Scanning FTIR 
(<a href="../research/publications/sp276-moeller.pdf">sFTIR</a>). The technology allows
a pressure sensitive touch screen to be placed anywhere a pane of glass would fit. It is
completely transparent and has no known wear mechanism, making it very durable.

<p class="people_text" clear="left">
Prior to my work in <a href="../research/sensoryInterfaces.html">embodied interfaces</a>, I was involved in the field of information semantics.
I designed the most recent semantic modeling code inside combinFormation, using a vector-space
representation to enhance the user's ability to find and collect information that is relevant 
to their needs. You can try combinFormation <a href="../combinFormation/">here.</a></p>

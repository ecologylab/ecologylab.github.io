<p class="people_text" clear="left">
I am a research scientist-artist investigating how people experience
personal expression, creative ideation, and social engagement.

I develop and evaluate expressive interfaces, computational
architectures, and distributed systems that support creative
processes of knowledge production
and interpersonal communication.

Essential research areas are human computer interaction, knowledge
management, digital libraries,
information visualization, gaming, 

wearable physiological computing,
sensor networks, pervasive computing, embedded systems, and software
engineering.

Intersecting fields include
pattern recognition, information retrieval,
cognitive psychology,
visual and interaction design, 
time-based media, ethnography, performance studies, music composition,
and conceptual art.
</p>

<p class="people_text">
I intend to create provocative  dynamics of thought, emotion, and
participation in and around information environments, tools,
installations, and performances.

I work to open the range of expressive, creative, and social processes
embodied by computational artifacts, developing interactivity in terms
beyond efficiency: discovery, play, contemplation, delight, and satisfaction. 
</p>

<p class="people_text">
<a class="destination" href="../research/index.html">My research</a> 
is grounded in <i><a class="destination" href="../research/ecosystemsApproach.html">interface ecology</a></i>. The
interface ecosystems
metaframework connects theory and practice to construct the
interface as a border zone between heterogeneous systems of
representation: personal and machinic, physical and electronic, analog
and digital, media and metholodogies. 
Forms and processes are transformed by the investigation of new
connections between these systems.
Fields of systematic language are transformed by the interjection of
personal expressive forms.
A <i>needs requirement</i> is reframed as an <i>expression of desire</i>.
</p>

<p class="people_text">
My research is embodied in systems: interfaces, ontologies, processing
frameworks, components. Science and engineering, art and design, 
the creative and the systematic, development and evaluation.
The goal is nothing short of
transforming the relations between human and machine to be more
joyful, to shift the balance of power in this equation in favor of
the sensitivities that characterize what it means to be human.
</p>

<p class="people_text">
<a href="../courses/index.html">My teaching</a> 
also connects theory and practice. I involve students in processes of
asking questions, as well as answering them. 
Methodologies are connected in the border zone of interface analysis
and synthesis. Human values are emphasized in the context of science
and engineering. Creative process and the expression of individuals
and groups are fostered.
</p>

<p class="people_text">
I have also worked extensively with integrated media performance,
music composition, and audio recording. Some of my work with sound can
be found <a href="andruidSound.html">here</a>.

Goode / Fry / Gray / Yen

Good game description, but watch grammar; team member assignments could use more thought, unclear on what a main menu vs. game window are [-1]; good program description; headers are fine

McClendon /  Poteet /  Rogers / Bell

Good game description; good team assignments; program description clear; headers mostly good, but should not need a player_1/2, etc. Each of these can just be instantiated; review object-oriented principles / classes / instances [-3]

8 Franco / Goodson / Chaulagain

Clear game description with citation; team assignments should be for project, not the team design document [-3]; good program description and header files

10 Piatt / Regmi / Clay

Clear game rules; unclear on what "algorithm implementation" means in team roles, seems vague [-1]; good description of program; piece_info is a two-dimensional array, not a 2x2 array (it is a 6x7 array), otherwise, good headers

7 

Clear game rules, but missing citation [-1]; team breakdown is hard to follow, should be more abstract [-2]; good program description; headers ok

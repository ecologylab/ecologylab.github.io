NOTE:  Please follow your lab instructor's directions for submitting
your assignment through CSNET.  ONLY ASSIGNMENTS SUBMITTED TO CSNET WILL
BE GRADED!  Make a printout of this cover sheet, sign it and give it to
your TA in lab or put it in your TA's mailbox in the corner of the 3rd
floor of HRBB, near room 312.  IF YOU DO NOT TURN IN A SIGNED COVER
SHEET YOUR WORK WILL NOT BE GRADED!

NOTE:  Homework will be graded on unix.cse.tamu.edu using g++.  You are
free to develop your programs on Visual C++ or any other platform, but
it is your responsibility to make sure your programs also compile and
execute correctly on unix.cs.tamu.edu using g++.

The grade for this lab will be based on style (formatting, variable
names, comments, etc.), syntax (no compilation or link errors), and
correctness (passes all test cases).  Your grade for this lab is:

Problem #       1       2      
Style            /2     /2      
Syntax           /3     /3      
Correctness      /10    /5    
Part #6          /2
Part #7          /12
Part #8          /3

	expression "-" term
	
term:
	primary
	term "*" primary
	term "/" primary
	term "%" primary
	
primary:

Name your program hw3pr1.cpp.

OPTIONAL EXTRA CREDIT =====================

4. (10 points) Modify the program above to handle the factorial
operation, !. Recall that n! ("n factorial") is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) *
... * 2. You will find it advantageous to update the grammar and
understand that it should be higher precedence than everything except 
parenthesis.

Name your program hw3pr2.cpp.

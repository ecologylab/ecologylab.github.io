        <h1>all about me</h1>
	<p>Within these pages exists information about me and my work (and some of my play).</p>
	<p>I am currently working on a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the <a target="_blank" href="../../">Interface
	   Ecology Lab</a> at Texas A&amp;M University. As part of my M.S. degree, I completed a thesis. I developed a new user
	   interface component, the In-Context Slider, designed to activate in the context of a situation 
	   allowing a user to complete a task without having to switch focus from the task at hand to
	   locate the necessary interface component.</p>
	<p>As you can see, I have an interest in computing. I tend to align myself on the visual
	   side of computing specifically the design of human-centered interfaces, but I have been known to 
	   sway towards the more theoretic and internal (but not less
	   beautiful) side of computing as well. I enjoy all facets of computing (except reboots and animated
	   assistants), but I suppose I lean to the aesthetic side due to the artist within me.</p>
	 <p>I'm an artist. In my free moments, I 
	   occasionally draw, paint, or photograph.  You can see a few of my photographs on this page.
	   On top of art, I also have a great love for music - listening and playing. In high school, I
	   picked up the bass guitar and played in a band. I still play...some. As for my musical taste, I
	   enjoy a wide variety of music. I mostly enjoy music with lots of syncopations and polyrhythms 
	   (i.e. jazz and all the new forms and hybrids resulting - particularly some of the more modern ones).</p>
     <p>Well, I think that explains me well enough. Now, go explore my website.

	<p>I'm currently involved in several different projects (one of which was my master's thesis).  Most of
	   these projects are currently part of or started as a result of assignments for school.</p>
	<h2>In-Context Slider</h2>
	<p><i>Thesis</i> - The In-Context Slider is a new transitory interface component for visualizing and adjusting
	a value at the user's current point of focus. The In-Context Slider was implemented inside 
	<a target="_blank" href="../../combinFormation/index.html">combinFormation</a> (described below) as a mechanism for interest expression for directing an agent within combinFormation. The prior method for interest expression in combinFormation involved a modal toolbar interface that required users to continually
	shift focus from one part of the screen to another. The In-Context Slider eliminated this problem.</p>
	<h2>choreographic buttons</h2>	
	<p style=" padding-right: 8px;">
		<img src="images/cb.jpg" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
	    Choreographic Buttons is an interactive art installation / design environment
		that uses gestures of the body as an interface for creating a collage.
	    project developed by a team including myself as part of a course titled 
	    <a target="_blank" href="../../courses/recombinant/index.html">Recominant
	    Media</a>. Choreographic Buttons has received publications in ACM Multimedia and the Leonardo Electronic
	    Almanac.

	    <a target="_blank" href="../../combinFormation/index.html">combinFormation</a> 
	    is a mixed-initiative system that uses composition for browsing, collecting, and arranging 
	    information samples from web pages. The samples act as visual, semiotic, and navigational 
	    surrogates for the documents from which they are extracted. I am currently involved in 
	    development on this application primarily with regards to my thesis but also in many other ways.

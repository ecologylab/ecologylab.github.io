			  <!--
			<p>
				I lead a team in the design and construction of an interactive art installation called 
				<a href="javascript:popUp('http://ecologylab.cs.tamu.edu/cb/', 'Choreographic Buttons', 995, 700);">Choreographic Buttons</a>. 
				The installation introduces a new type of affordance, the choreographic button, which integrates 
				movement, gesture recognition, and interactive visual feedback. As leader of the team, I was involved 
				in every aspect of designing and building the installation. My responsibilities included 
				developing the motion tracking algorithm for gesture recognition, curating a collection of images,
				designing the graphical affordances, managing the other team members, and tying all the pieces together. Choreographic Buttons
				has received publications in both ACM Multimedia and the Leonardo Electronic Almanac.

			        <p>The In-Context Slider is my thesis project, <a href="javascript:popUp('../awebb-thesis.pdf', '', 995, 700);"><i>A Transitory 
				Interface Component for In-Context Visualization and Adjustment of a Value</i></a>. The In-Context Slider is a new transitory 
				slider interface component that seeks to reduce demand on user attention and cognitive effort by providing an interface that 
				appears when needed near the point of focus. The In-Context Slider was implemented in 
				<a href="http://ecologylab.cs.tamu.edu/combinFormation/" target="_blank">
				combinFormation</a> (cF) as a mechanism for expressing interest. combinFormation is a creativity support tool that integrates 
				processes of searching, browsing, collecting, mixing, organizing, and thinking about information. The prior interest 
				expression interface in cF was a modal toolbar interface that required the user to constantly switch back and forth
				between an element being worked on the toolbar interface. The In-Context Slider provides the user with an slider at the point of 
				focus, so the user can more easily maintain focus on the task at hand.</p>
				
				<p>The current version of combinFormation uses the In-Context Slider and can be found <a href="http://ecologylab.cs.tamu.edu/combinFormation">here</a>.

		<item title="Structures of Interactive Information" screen="cpsc489.png">
			<!--
			<p>
			  I developed this website for a course called <a href="http://ecologylab.cs.tamu.edu/courses/sii/" target="_blank">
				Structures of Interactive Information</a> that I took as an 
				undergraduate student in Spring 2004 semester at Texas A&amp;M University.  The course covered among other things
				design issues involving structures of information such as affordances, layering, and mappings.   
			</p>
			<p>
				We conducted two major projects for the course.  I have included them as well in my portfolio.

			  The EssaySketch project is an assignment I developed for my Structures of Interactive Information course.  What 
				exactly is an EssaySketch?  Put simply, it is a combination of an essay and a sketch.  The material for the
				essay portion was to be derived from several nodes.  Each node represented an author and his ideas pertaining to 
				structures of information.  Some of the authors are Jorge Luis Borges, Marcel Duchamp, Ted Nelson, Johannes Itten,
				and Vanevar Bush.  The sketch portion represented the actual design metaphor for relating the nodes.
			</p>
			<p>
				My concept for this assignment was based off the board game Scrabble.  It was possible to use all the authors' names
				if starting with the base word of &quot;conceptual&quot; for the conceptual nodes and &quot;visual&quot; for the visual
				nodes.  I had original planned for the project to be more like a real game of scrabble with points scored and everything.
				The project ended up not being as complex as planned due to time constraints and the realization that something simpler 
				work just as well.

		<item title="Dynamic Ontology Map" screen="final.jpg">
			<!--
			<p>
			The Dynamic Ontology Map is another assignment I created for my Structures of Interactive Information course.  The 
			project involved developing a new ontology for an existing collection.  During the semester, I had created a 
			<a href="sii/journal/week01.html" target="_blank">journal</a> 
			(another assignment for the course) which acted as my collection.  My love for hexagons led me to derive six attributes 
			to form my ontology.  Each attribute represented an axis from the center of the hexagon to one of the six vertices on the
			perimeter.

			<!--
			<p>
				This is my personal website.  It contains information about myself such as my hobbies, a resume, and my portfolio.  Within 
				the site, the image at the top is chosen at random and comes from a selection of photographs I took in a photography course.  As well, 
				I have created several icons to provide references to other pages on the site.  For example if I refer to my resume 
				anywhere in the site, the resume icon will appear at this point of reference.

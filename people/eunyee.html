My research interests include web mining and internet technology. I am
 applying  these technologies in the context of
human-centered systems, such as
<a target="_blank"

For example, Google generates search results based on PageRank. 
The result is that people can usually get more relevant results from
Google than from other search engines.  
My thesis topic will incorporate measures such as PageRank, and
recency/frequency to model the spontaneous evolution of personal
interests during processes of
information discovery. With these mesurements, 
our system will become more able to effectively generate relevant and
interesting information compositions.

I am also interested in how people collect, organize, and utilize digital information. I conducted a study by interviewing college students. Interview questions include how they collect digital information and files and what kinds of mechnism they used to manage their information. 
Also, they were asked about their inconveniences and breakdowns in the current practices. 
Both qualitative interview data and quantitative survey data was analyzed and 
more research will be conducted to support people to have better representation of collections
so that they can utilize their collections more easily and efficiently.

I am interested in the cross-disciplinary pollination of critical thought.  How can artists use the tools of media and science to communicate a deeper understanding of our position in the world?</p>

<p>My research crosses boundaries by experimenting with video in a video game environment presented through the interface of an installation. I am interested in video games and their experimental use in the production of visual art. In this regard, my work focuses on the use of non-linear narrative rather than traditional storytelling. I view the video game as an opportunity for the delivery of ideas in a metaphorical and poetic sense rather than solely as a continuation of cinematic tradition. The video game also provides an opportunity to study the human-computer interface and its impact on the development of aesthetic experience. How can we design interfaces that encourage, or at least don&rsquo;t thwart, critical reflection on behalf of the viewer? To this end, I have been working with the idea of the video game combined with installation, attempting to identify forms of interaction that deepen both audience and participant immersion within the environment.</p>
<p>These are some of the questions that make digital art, video game technology and installation challenging and interesting to me, artistically and academically. I believe that further experimentation and development of these technologies will benefit us all as we attempt to understand our relationship to each other and machines.</p>

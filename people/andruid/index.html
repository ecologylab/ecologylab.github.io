Andruid Kerne is an interdisciplinary researcher working to invent the future of human expression. 
My Interface Ecology Lab develops human-centered systems that amalgamate design, algorithms, semantics, software, and hardware. 
In conjunction with computing, we synthesize methods from art, design, psychology, and sociology. 
</p>

<p>
I hold a B.A. in applied mathematics / electronic media from Harvard, an M.A. in music composition from Wesleyan, 
and a Ph.D. in computer science from NYU. 
I have published over 100 papers. 
I have raised over $3M in research funding. 
I am a Program Chair of ACM Creativity and Cognition 2019.
</p>

<p>
I create provocative  dynamics of thought, emotion, and
participation in and around information environments, tools,
installations, and performances.

This opens the range of expressive, creative, and social processes
embodied by computational artifacts, developing interactivity in terms
beyond efficiency: ideation, play, participation, and delight. 
</p>

<p>
<a class="destination" href="../../research/index.html">Our research</a> 
is grounded in <i><a class="destination" href="../../define.html">interface ecology</a></i>. 
  Interface ecology goes meta, connecting theory and practice to construct the
interface as a border zone between heterogeneous systems of
representation: personal and machinic, physical and electronic, analog
and digital, media and methodologies. 
Forms and processes are transformed by investigations of new
connections among systems across levels.
Fields of systematic language are transformed through the interjection of
personal expressive forms.
</p>

<p>
Our research is embodied in systems: interfaces, ontologies, processing
frameworks, components. Science and engineering, art and design, 
the creative and the systematic, development and evaluation.
The goal is nothing short of
transforming the relations between human and machine to be more
expressive and joyful, to shift the balance of power in this equation in favor of
the sensitivities that characterize what it means to be human.
</p>

<p>
<a class="destination" href="../../courses/index.html">My teaching</a> 
 connects theory and practice. I involve students in processes of
asking questions, as well as answering them; in defining problems, as well as solving them. 
Methodologies are connected in the border zone of interface analysis
and synthesis. Human values are emphasized in the context of science
and engineering. Creative process and the expression of individuals
and groups are fostered.
</p>

<p>
I have worked extensively with integrated media performance,
music composition, and audio recording. Some of my work with sound can
be found <a class="destination" href="andruidSound.html">here</a>.

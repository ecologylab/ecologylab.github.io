<p class="people_text" clear="left">
I was born and raised in Kwang-ju, Korea. After graduating high school, I left home  for a higher education. I graduated from Hankuk University of Forein Studies (Seoul, Korea) where I had studied laws, and I served in the Korean military for about 2 years. I crossed the Pacific Ocean to study psychology in the Fall of 1996. I obtained my second bachelor's degree at Southwest State University (Marshall, Minnesota) and a master's degree in experimental psychology at Central Michigan University (Mt. Pleasant, Michigan). I came to Texas A&M University in 2000 and have since been actively involved in research on memory blocking and recovery, false memory, tip-of-the-tongue states, and creative cognition under the auspices of Dr. Steve Smith.   
</p>
<p class="people_text">
My research interests are primarily in (but not limited to) human memory and metacognition. My other interests include creative cognition, problem-solving, and language. I intend to pursue an eclectic approach to studying human cognition via interdisciplinary research bridging between psychology and various areas such as engineering, business, computer science, arts, linguistics, literature and education.

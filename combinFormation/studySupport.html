href="javascript:launchPopup('http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/information')">fawr-mey-shuhn</a>).
<br/>Please check out the menu to the right, as it connects you to important
information about how to operate our software.
   <br/><br/><br/>
   <a href="javascript:displaySection('launch')">Launch combinFormation</a>
   to use the internet for <a
   href="javascript:displaySection('expressing')">expressing</a> your
   creativity. (something we noticed is that)
   It does a fine job of <a href="javascript:displaySection('hotAndCool')">organizing</a> and
   <a href="javascript:displaySection('dnd')">collecting</a>
information as well! Sometimes when you use it, you'll
   discover that (all of a sudden) you found something new and unique,
something important to you that would have been REALLY hard
   to find if you were just using
   <a href="javascript:supplementalPopup('http://google.com')">google</a>, or
   <a href="javascript:supplementalPopup('http://yahoo.com')">yahoo</a>, or
   <a href="javascript:supplementalPopup('http://www.live.com/?searchonly=true')">liveSearch</a>.
   <br/><br/><br/>
   Think of combinFormation as a different way to see all those search
engines out there, which intelligently
   searches webpages (as intially found by google, yahoo, etc) for any relevant pieces of information.
   We constantly use combinFormation ourselves, and hope you will too!

<h1>support &rsaquo; FAQ</h1>

<ol>
	<li>
		<h2>What does combinFormation really do and why will I find it useful?</h2>

		combinFormation provides a mixed-initiative composition space for searching, 
		browsing, collecting, and organizing from the net and other information sources. 
		If you use it, you'll discover that (all of a sudden) you found something new and 
		unique that would have been REALLY hard to find if you were just using google, or yahoo, 
		or liveSearch. 

		<br/><br/><a href='support.html?section=introduction'>Find out more!</a>
	</li>

	<li> 
		<h2>What are the system requirements to run combinFormation?</h2>
		
		What OS (windows, mac, linux, etc), CPU (pentium III, PPC),
			resolution (1024x768, 800x600, etc) and how much RAM does my system need
			to run combinFormation?

		For best performance, combinFormation requires recent hardware:
		a nice monitor, plenty of RAM, and a fast CPU.
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				Monitor (display and resolution)
				You should have at least a 17 inch monitor.
				Set the display resolution (using the Control Panel) as high as possible.
				At least 1024x768 is strongly recommended. 
			</li>
		
			<li> 
				Memory (RAM)
				At least 768M (megabytes) of RAM is essential.
			        1 G preferred.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Computer (OS and CPU)
				PC
					Pentium 4 1.6+ Ghz.
					Windows 2000/XP
				MACINTOSH
					G5 or Core Duo are recommended. 
					OSX 10.4+ (since Java 5.0 is only available on Tiger+)
				LINUX
					Pentium 4 1.0+ Ghz.
					Any linux distribution
				
				-- Note
				bigger display -> better experience
				more RAM + faster CPU = better performance

			<h2>What software do I need to run combinFormation?</h2>

			You need two things, a reasonably new version of Java, and a reasonably new web browser:
			<br/><br/>
			
			<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:smaller">JAVA: </span><br/>
			Java version 5 is required. Java is a standard Web technology developed by Sun Microsytems.
			
			<br/><br/>
			What you need is the JRE (Java Runtime Environment): <br/>

			Mac users get it <a href='http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/java/'>here</a>. <br/>

			<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:smaller">WEB BROWSER: </span><br/>
			Macintosh, Windows XP, Linux: Firefox 2 <br/>
			This is the preferred browser. Firefox 1.5 will also work. Install our

			Macintosh: Safari <br/>
			Safari is not supported. Get Firefox if you need to.
			<br/><br/>
			
			WINDOWS XP: Internet Explorer 6 <br/>
			Internet Explorer 6 will work, except that drag and drop is nicer with Firefox.
			<br/><br/>
			
			WINDOWS XP: Internet Explorer 7 <br/>
			This browser is a mess. There are problems. We're working on a solution. We'll post it here.

   <h4>WINDOWS XP: Internet Explorer 6</h4>
   Internet Explorer (IE) 6 will work, except that drag and drop is nicer

   <h4>WINDOWS XP: Internet Explorer 7</h4>
   This browser is a mess. We apologize for how complex this is.
If you can, use Firefox! 
<br/><br/> For Texas A&M Students who use IE7 in Student Computing Center,
you need to execute this sequence IN ORDER:

<br /> 5. Click "Launch" again 
<br/><br/>Otherwise, you have to do special setup:

<ul>
  <li>Open <code>Tools > Internet Options</code>.</li>

   We have seen that sometimes Java holds onto old versions of files in
   its cache, even though it shouldn't, since we've released new
   versions.

   <div class="lilp">
   To work around this problem, do the following:
   </div>

      <li>You should arrive at the <code><b>General</b></code> tab.

   combinFormation provides support for drag and drop of information

   is very important to maintain the association between the element
   and its source web page. We are not able to accomplish this using
   the standard functionality provided by browsers and Java.
   <br>
   <br>
   To overcome this limitation, we have created an extension to the
   Firefox browser. You must install
   <a href="fireFoxDnd/cfTools.xpi" onclick=" return installCfTools(this);">this extension</a>
    to use drag and drop properly.
   <br>

   <b>Note:</b> you will have to tell the
   browser that you trust the <i>ecologylab.cs.tamu.edu</i> website as the
   source of extensions in order to do this.

   After saving a composition space, you can easily move it onto a web
   server. This is the same as what you would do to publish a regular
   HTML web page. You can then link the composition space into a
   regular web page.
   </p>
   <p>

   In order to do this, you must create a link tag in HTML that
   connects your published composition space to
   <i>combinFormation</i>. You do this by passing your space to a
   special publisher's page that we have arranged for you.
   </p>
   <p>

   You can do it like this<br/>
   <span class="small">(expect without line breaks in the midst of
   the url)</span>:

   <br/>
   <br/>

   <code>
      &lt;a target="_blank"<br/>
      href="http://ecologylab.cs.tamu.edu<br/>
      /combinformation/launch/regenerate.html?<br/>
      infospace=http://yourserver.net/yourDir/yourSpace.xml"&gt;<br>
   </code>
   </p>

   <p>
   There are some additional arguments you can pass. One controls
   whether the composition space will start with the generative agent
   playing or paused. The default is paused. Also, you can pass a
   title in for the published composition space. This title will be
   integrated into the intermediate web page that your users launch
   <i>combinFormation</i> from. (You must also change all instances of
   space to %20 in this title.) For example
   </p>
   <p>

   <code>
      &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://ecologylab.cs.tamu.edu/combinformation/launch/regenerate.html?infospace=http://yourserver.net/yourDir/yourSpace.xml&amp;start=play&amp;title=Zinnias%20and%20Petunias"&gt;<br>

   </code>
   </p>
   <p>
   As an alternative, you may include a small JavaScript file that we
   provide. Then, you will get a small <i>combinFormation</i> launch
   window, that will not cover up your page. Additionally, you will no
   longer need to convert spaces. The JavaScript function calling
   syntax is simpler:
   </p>
   <p>

   <code>

      function regeneratePopup(infospace, title, start)
   </code>
   </p>
   <p>
   For example,
   </p>
   <p>

   <code>
      &lt;script src="http://ecologylab.cs.tamu.edu/combinformation/publish.js"
      language="JavaScript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

   </code>
   </p>
   <p>
   <code>
      &lt;a
      href="javascript:regeneratePopup('http://yourserver.net/yourDir/yourSpace.xml', 'Zinnias and Petunias', 'play')"&gt;
   </code>
   </p>
